## CALCULATION OF MAJOR GPA
Courses listed under the major requirements for the degree will be included in the calculation of the major GPA. Courses that could not apply toward the major as an elective or required course would not be counted in the calculation of the major GPA. This would include CIS 1056, for example.

## DISTINCTION IN MAJOR

To graduate with Distinction in Major, students are required to have a 3.50 or higher grade point average (GPA) both in the major and overall, as well as be recommended by the department of Computer & Information Sciences.
