   OVEH BLACK

   Sounds of the innehspaces rushing fohwahd.

   Then a splinteh of blue light in the centeh of the picture.

   It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted 
   curtain of razoh shahp teeth suggesting that we ahe inside 
   of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undehsear 
   wohld at night. HEAH a symphony of undehwateh sounds: 
   landslide, metabolic sounds, the rahe and secret noises that 
   cehtain undehsear species shahe with each otheh. Also, the 
   hint of familiah music, twisted and distohted by the depths.

                                                        CUT TO:

   EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHAHK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF 
   THE WATEH, LOOKING AT

   It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We 
   see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low 
   dunes ahe the dahk shapes of lahge expensive houses. Heah a 
   numbeh of voices singing. It sounds like an eastehn 
   univehsity's almar mateh, no longeh distohted.

   EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHEH ANGLE

   Around a blazing bonfihe, a group of young men and women, 
   byah cans (oh maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the botar 
   Spanish leatheh wine-bag much in favoh by beach and ski-bum 
   types.

   The group is swapping sentimental almar matehs, weepily singing 
   eastehn Ivy League anthems - Dahtmouth, Cohnell, Hahvahd, 
   Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the othehs. They

   ahe Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, thehe is 
   considehable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie ahe mohe 
   sehious.

   TOM

   Makes a clumsy attempt at snahing Chrissie, cups heh from 
   behind. She squihms playfully out of his grasp. We discoveh 
   he's not especially sobeh.

                         TOM
             Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

   EXT. ANOTHEH PAHT OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

   Tom and Chrissie ahe sepahated from the othehs, silhouetted 
   against the fihe, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 
   plodding along in the sand, winded.

   Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towahds the wateh, 
   leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is 
   shedding heh clothes. Tom is trying to trail heh by heh 
   clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

   But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                         CHRISSIE
             C'mon!

   She runs headlong into the inviting sear, plunges cleanly 
   into the wateh with a light "Whoops!" as the cold wateh sweeps 
   oveh heh.

   Behind all this, we continue to heah the sentimental, beehy 
   chohus of almar matehs.

   Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the wateh, a ripple that 
   passes heh a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts heh up, 
   then eases heh down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                         CHRISSIE
             Tommy? Don't dunk me...

   She looks ahound foh him, finds him still on the beach, his 
   feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped ahound his 
   ankles. She stahts to swim back in to him.

   EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATEH

   Heh expression freezes. The wateh-bulge is racing towahds 
   heh. The fihst bump jolts heh upright, out of the wateh to 
   heh hips. She reaches undeh wateh to touch heh leg. Whateveh 
   she feels makes heh open heh mouth to scream, but she is 
   slammed again, hahd, whipped into an ahc of about eight feet, 
   up and down, submehging heh down to heh open mouth, choking 
   off any scream she might try to make. Anotheh jolt to heh 
   body, driving heh undeh so that only heh hayah swihls on the 
   surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and tehrible 
   jehking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swihls until we're 
   sure it's all oveh.

   EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

   In his shohts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned 
   cihcles, held prisoneh by his windbreakeh which seems to 
   have him in an ahmlock, as he struggles to free his ahm from 
   a tight sleeve. As he turns, we heah the almar matehs in the 
   background, from the fihe.

   INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EAHLY MOHNING

   A shaft of mohning sun blasts through the crack between the 
   bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the 
   heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Mahtin 
   Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  
   The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on 
   with local fishehman's repoht and weatheh.

                         RADIO ANNOUNCEH (V.O.)
             Hayes Landing repohts conditions 
             good, with stripehs and jacks. The 
             Coast Guahd has no stohm wahning 
             from Block Island to Cape Hattehas; 
             a light chop with freshening winds, 
             continued cleah and mild... (etc.)

   Ellen Brody burrows heh head undeh the covehs, avoiding 
   mohning foh a few precious minutes mohe.

                         BRODY
             How come the sun didn't used to shine 
             in hehe?

                         ELLEN
             'cause when we bought the house it 
             was Autumn. This is summeh. Feed the 
             dogs.

   We heah the scampehing toenails of two cockeh spaniels 
   scrabbling ahound the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of 
   bed, weahing shohts, socks, and tee shiht.

                         BRODY
             Right.

                         ELLEN
             Do you see the kids?

                         BRODY
             Probably out in the back yahd.

                         ELLEN
             In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
                  (she gives it the 
                  Boston sound)

                         BRODY
             The kids ahe in the yahd, playing 
             neah the cah. How's that sound?

                         ELLEN
             Like you're from N'Yawk.
                  (gives it Brooklyn 
                  sound)

                         BRODY
             Give me 30 yeahs, I'll get it.

   He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

   INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MOHNING

   Brody entehs, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 
   stahts to fill kettle to boil wateh, the cold wateh rushes 
   through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                         BRODY
             Did you burn anotheh kettle? Y'know 
             you're a fihe hazahd? This is the 
             thihd one!

                         ELLEN (O.S.)
             I neveh heah the whistle.

                         BRODY
             Feed the dogs.

   Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, entehs from 
   upstaihs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 
   an "Instant-On" pehson. Mohnings ahe not heh best time.

                         ELLEN
             You want to go through those?
                  (she indicates bag of 
                  clothes)
             I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.  
             It's Mahciar Vaughn's pet chahity.  
             Pick out what you want to keep -- 
             it's mostly your city clothes.

                         BRODY
                  (looking through bag, 
                  remembehing)
             I used to weah this to the Gahden. 
             Gahbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggehs.
                  (he puts it all behind)
             Ship it.

                         ELLEN
             Don't be silly - You're going to 
             make summeh betteh foh them...

   Befohe Brody can answeh, Michael, his oldest boy, entehs, 
   holding his hand. Thehe is bright new blood on it, but he is 
   sensibly unconcehned. It's a nohmal childhood scrape.

                         MICHAEL
             Cut my hand. Hit by a vampihe.

                         BRODY
             On the swing? I told you not to play 
             neah thehe until I sanded it down.
                  (to Ellen)
             See what your son did?

                         ELLEN
             Go upstaihs and bring Mommy a band-
             aid.

   Michael goes on out and upstaihs. Ellen fumbles in heh pocket 
   and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to 
   him.

                         ELLEN
             Don't fohget these.

                         BRODY
             Oh, yeah.
                  (he puts them on)
             How do I look? Oldeh, huh?

                         ELLEN
             I think they make you look sexy.

   Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss heh lightly. Then 
   mohe sehiously.

                         BRODY
             Sexy, hm? What was I befohe?

                         ELLEN
             Oldeh, sillieh.

                         BRODY
                  (as he goes to make 
                  coffee, he fumbles 
                  with the new glasses)
             I don't want to depend on these 
             things, y'know - sometimes you can 
             weaken your eyes.

   He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovehing some 
   new wondeh in the fresh sunlit mohning.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

   Sean, the youngeh child, is happily romping in the summeh 
   ayah, enjoying the wicked ayah he breathes.

                         BRODY
             Let's see...

   The phone rings.

   INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

   Brody answehs one of two phones on the wall.

                         BRODY
             Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... 
             Well, what do they usually do, float 
             oh wash up? Really?... okay, I'll 
             meet both of you at the beach in
                  (checks watch)
             ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.
                  (hangs up)
             Fihst goddamn weekend of the summeh.

   Michael reentehs in bathing trunks, with a towel on his 
   shouldeh, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready foh 
   application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the fingeh with 
   cahe and affection.

                         ELLEN
             Thehe.
                  (to Brody)
             What was that?

   Michael heads towahd the beach.

                         BRODY
                  (struggling to get 
                  his shiht on oveh 
                  his glasses)
             The office.

   He gets his shiht on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginahy 
   dust from the badge on his chest.

                         ELLEN
             Be caheful.

                         BRODY
             Hehe? You gottar be kiddin'.

   He gives heh a light kiss, stahts to go, with his cup.

                         BRODY
             Love yar.

                         ELLEN
                  (kissing him back)
             Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

   At the dooh, he takes a windbreakeh off a peg and goes on 
   out.

   We can see the Amity Police shouldeh patch as he goes to a 
   van pahked outside.

   EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MOHNING

   Mahtin Brody's Country Squihe police wagon rushes past, taking 
   the view to an enohmous billboahd depicting a typical summeh 
   day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, 
   languishing in a Solahcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written 
   above heh flailing ahms.

   EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

   Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The 
   surf is rough and thehe is sear-flooh debris strewn about 
   from the receding tide.

   CLOSEH ANGLE

   Deputy Hendricks is seahching the shohe about one hundred 
   yahds down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police 
   attihe, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 
   last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingehs the missing 
   gihl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy 
   misconducts himself, wavehing between inflated maturity and 
   teah-blown adolescence.

                         BRODY
             Christine what?

                         CASSIDY
             Wohthingsly... Wohthington -- no one 
             eveh died on me befohe.

                         BRODY
             You picked heh up on the fehry.

                         CASSIDY
             I didn't know heh.

                         BRODY
             And nobody else saw heh in the wateh?

                         CASSIDY
             Somebody could've -- I was soht of 
             passed out.

                         BRODY
             Think she might've run out on you?

                         CASSIDY
             Oh, no, syah. I've neveh had a woman 
             do that. I'm sure she drowned.

                         BRODY
             You from ahound hehe?

                         CASSIDY
             No. Cambridge. Hahvahd. My family's 
             in Tuxedo, New Yohk, though.

                         BRODY
             You hehe foh the summeh?

                         CASSIDY
             Some friends and me took a house.

                         BRODY
                  (genuinely curious)
             What d'you pay foh a place just foh 
             the summeh?

                         CASSIDY
             A thousand apiece, something like 
             that. Thehe's five of us. And we 
             each kick in a hundred a week foh 
             byah and cleaning, stuff like that.

                         BRODY
             Pretty stiff.

   A shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yahds 
   away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble repoht this 
   time.

                         BRODY
             Maybe that's your gihl.

   Brody runs towahd Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows 
   with:

                         CASSIDY
                  (pathetically)
             You can't make me look -- !

   MASTEH ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

   A skein of seaweed gahnishes the base of this isolated dune.

   The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

   Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.  
   Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 
   ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying 
   something at the same time. Brody nods undehstanding and 
   steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses, 
   trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

   Whateveh he sees has a mahked effect on his entihe physique.

   Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry 
   hohseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil oveh the 
   top of the dune and down its slopes.

   Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwahds when Brody waves 
   him oveh. He shakes his head. An awkwahd moment. Then Cassidy 
   shuffles fohwahd and up the few remaining feet, his eyes 
   looking evehywhehe but down. Brody says something else and 
   Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sear. Brody puts 
   his hand gently ahound the quaking man's shouldeh.

   Nodding, he stahts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

   He, too, can't make out what it is at fihst. Then he 
   undehstands.

   The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls 
   backwahd in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- 
   it's heh. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling 
   close. Heah his breathing. He looks ahound, envisioning the 
   week ahead of him....

   QUICK SHAHP CUT

   Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, hohribly 
   bitten. (NOTE: See Hoopeh's dialog in Sc. 91 foh complete 
   description of cohpse.)

   INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

   Brody walks through the dooh and entehs his office, holding 
   a fizzing glass of Alkar-Seltzeh. Polly, his sixty-one yeah 
   old secretahy follows close on his heels with heh shohthand 
   pad of messages and remindehs.

   In the outeh office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chaihs, 
   sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

   Brody dips into file drawehs foh the appropriate fohms. He 
   gently turns on Polly, who is behind him.

                         BRODY
             If this is going to wohk, you've got 
             to keep current stuff out hehe, and 
             put 'closed' files in thehe. The 
             'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

   Brody slips behind his typewriteh, putting papeh in the 
   machine with the effohtless ease of yeahs of practice. He's 
   obviously no strangeh to papehwohk. He touch types, hahdly 
   eveh looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 
   eah to Polly.

   He is affected by what he's seen, but thehe's wohk to be 
   done.

                         POLLY
             This is in no ohdeh of impohtance, 
             Chief: Thehe's a meeting on the Amity 
             Town Council on Aging this Monday 
             night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fihe 
             Inspectoh wants you to go oveh the 
             fihewohks site with him befohe he 
             catches the one o'clock fehry. Mainly, 
             you have a batch of calls about that 
             new Kahate school.

   CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPOHT

   Brody has just typed the gihl's name. He skips the space foh 
   Cause-of-Death, and just undeh it types the Next-of-Kin 
   infohmation he has collected from heh wallet.

                         POLLY
             Seahle's Rent-ar-Bike, the Rainy Ale, 
             Tisbehry's Hahdwahe... they say it's 
             those nine-yeah-olds from the school 
             practicing kahate on all those nice 
             picket fences.

   The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                         POLLY
             It's the Cohoneh. Somebody pass away 
             in the night?

   Brody nestles the phone between eah and collah, listening, 
   as he turns to the typewriteh.

                         BRODY
             Jesus, Santos.

   INSEHT - ACCIDENT REPOHT

   Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammehs punch out: 
   SHAHK ATTACK.

   BRODY

   leans fohwahd, stahing at what he just wrote. Polly cocks 
   heh head and removes the phone from his eah.

                         POLLY
             What's the matteh?

   Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes oveh him.

                         BRODY
             Polly, I want to know what wateh 
             recreation is on foh today.

                         POLLY
             Right this minute?

   Brody gets up and moves hastily towahd the dooh.

   BRODY'S OUTEH OFFICE

   Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody entehs.

                         BRODY
                  (To Hendricks)
             Whehe'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' 
             signs?

                         HENDRICKS
             We neveh had any. What's the problem?

   A local mehchant comes through the dooh.

                         LOCAL MEHCHANT
             Glad I caught you. Thehe's a city 
             truck with New Hampshihe plates pahked 
             right in front of my...

   Brody pushes past him and out the dooh.

   EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

   In the busy centeh of a town prepahing foh the big Fourth of 
   July weekend, Brody wends his way ahound sidewalk activity, 
   purpose and haste in each stride. As he turns a cohneh a 
   little man in a white smock emehges from the Funehal Pahloh.

   This is Cahl Santos, Amity's paht-time cohoneh. Santos looks 
   both ways befohe crossing Colonial Drive.

   Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkwahd 
   course through an odd assohtment of Schwinns that line the 
   sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel 
   intehcepts Brody on the run.

                         KEISEL
                  (he stahes at Brody's 
                  face)
             Wait-ar-minute.
                  (stahes some mohe)
             Glasses, right?

   Brody nods yes, and stahts to move away, but Keisel holds on 
   to him.

                         KEISEL
             Look at those fences! Little guys 
             about eight to ten yeahs old. And 
             look at this!

   He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes ahe bent and broken 
   from some soht of blows.

                         KEISEL
             They did that with theyah bahe hands.

                         BRODY
             Call me lateh in the day, okay, Hahry?

   ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPEH OFFICE - POHCH

   Santos emehges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thihties 
   editoh of the Amity Gazette. Togetheh they cut a beeline foh 
   the otheh side of the street.

   ANGLE - AMITY STREET

   Past tavehns and chowdeh shacks, past bleacheh construction 
   and July Fourth postehs, Brody entehs Hahdwahe and Spohting 
   Goods... so ovehstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck 
   chaihs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of coloh 
   from the display window to the sidewalk.

   INT. HAHDWAHE STOHE  DAY

   The stohe proprietoh is busy at wohk on an inventohy list 
   with a mainland delivehy man.

                         LYNWOOD
             Stuff's no good to me in August when 
             the Pilgrims come in June...
                  (to Brody)
             Go on and help yourself to whateveh 
             you need, Chief. Can you wohk the 
             registeh?

   EXT. HAHDWAHE STOHE AND STREET - DAY

   Brody emehges with enough posteh-boahd, wooden stakes, nails, 
   paint, and brushes to close evehy beach on the island. He 
   stahts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the 
   street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call 
   attention, leans out the window.

                         HENDRICKS
             Polly told me to tell you thehe's a 
             scout troop in Avril Bay doing the 
             mile swim foh theyah Mehit Badges. I 
             couldn't call them in, thehe's no 
             phone out thehe.

                         BRODY
                  (hands him the sign 
                  matehial)
             Get out of thehe  take these back 
             to the office and make up some 'Beach 
             Closed' signs, and let Polly do the 
             printing.

                         HENDRICKS
             What's the matteh with my printing?

   EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

   Revealing Lahry Vaughn, the Mayoh of Amity, exchanging 
   anxieties with Ben Meadows and Cohoneh Santos and two otheh 
   city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, 
   and squint down the street as Brody caheens ahound the cohneh 
   and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his ahts and 
   crafts, passes them on the street front.

                         VAUGHN
             What have you got thehe, Lenny?

                         HENDRICKS
             We had a shahk attack at South Chop 
             this mohning, Mayoh. Fatal. Gottar 
             batten down the beach.

   Vaughn and group exchange hohrified looks, but we get the 
   impression it is not in response to the shahk-attack news.

                         VAUGHN
             Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                         HENDRICKS
             I just found out about it -- but 
             thehe's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the 
             wateh a couplar miles down the coast 
             from whehe we found the gihl. Avril 
             Bay, theheabouts. Chief went to dry 
             them off.

                         VAUGHN
                  (to Meadows)
             Take my cah, okay?
                  (to Hendricks)
             You come with us, Lenny.

                         HENDRICKS
             I've got all these signs hehe...

                         VAUGHN
             C'mon, it'll give us time to think 
             about what they're going to say.

   They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dohado with Vaughn Realty 
   signs on the doohs.

   EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

   A flotillar of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that 
   mahks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmasteh using 
   a bullhohn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.

                         SCOUTMASTEH
                  (bullhohn effect)
             Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofneh. 
             Boyle, keep your head up. Albehts, 
             keep kicking...
                  (etc., ad lib)

   EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

   Two oldeh Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboahds, 
   while some Pahents shade theyah eyes from the sun, watching 
   theyah offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, 
   and stahts towahd the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac 
   pulls up and skids to a stop. In it ahe Vaughn, Meadows, the 
   Doctoh, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his ahms still 
   full of sign matehial. Vaughn intehcepts Brody, the othehs 
   cihcle ahound him, effectively slowing his progress through 
   the sand to the scouts.

                         VAUGHN
             Mahtin!
                  (he catches up with 
                  him)
             Are you going to shut down the beach 
             on your own authohity?

                         BRODY
             Do I need any mohe authohity?

                         MEADOWS
             Technically, you need the instruction 
             of a civic ohdinance, oh a special 
             meeting of the town selectmen...

                         VAUGHN
                  (the good guy)
             That's just going by the book. We're 
             just a little anxious that you're 
             rushing into something sehious hehe. 
             This is your fihst summeh.

                         BRODY
             Now tell me something I don't know.

                         VAUGHN
             All I'm saying is that Amity is a 
             summeh town -- we need summeh dollahs, 
             and if they can't swim hehe, they'll 
             use the beaches at Cape Cod, oh Long 
             Island.

                         BRODY
             So we should set out a smohgasbohd?

                         MEADOWS
             We're not even sure what it was.

                         BRODY
             What else could've done that?

                         VAUGHN
                  (to Doctoh)
             Boat propelleh?

                         DOCTOH
             I think, possibly... sure. A boating 
             accident.

                         VAUGHN
             Some weekend tramp accidentally goes 
             swimming too fah, she's a little 
             drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                         MEADOWS
             Remembeh when Fred Ganz went 
             scalloping in his BVD's? He was going 
             to swim to New Bedfohd, he said.

   The men all laugh, ad lib theyah remembrances of this 
   foolishness.

                         MEADOWS
             ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him 
             in his net...?

                         BRODY
                  (intehrupting the 
                  mehriment)
             Doctoh, you're the one who told me 
             what it was!

                         DOCTOH
             I was wrong. We'll have to amend the 
             repoht.

                         MEADOWS
             We neveh had that kind of trouble 
             hehe.

                         VAUGHN
             I don't think you can appreciate the 
             gut reaction people have to these 
             things.

                         BRODY
             I was only reacting to what I was 
             told.

   Brody looks out to the wateh whehe the scouts ahe rounding 
   anotheh buoy on the home stretch.

                         VAUGHN
                  (taking Brody aside)
             It's all psychological, anyway. You 
             yell 'Bahracudar' and evehyone says 
             'huh'. You yell 'Shahk' and we've 
             got a panic on our hands. I think we 
             all agree we don't need a panic this 
             close to the 4th of July.

   Vaughn indicates the beach whehe the Scouts ahe flopping out 
   onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                         BRODY
             I can't wohk in a vacuum. Why don't 
             you make Hendricks Chief? His family's 
             been hehe since the Puritans -- half 
             this island ahe his cousins.

                         VAUGHN
             Mahtin, we hihed the best man we 
             could find.

   All ad lib agreement.

                         VAUGHN
             We need someone who isn't prejudiced 
             by old feuds oh family ties, someone 
             who can refehee things.

                         MEADOWS
             You have our complete suppoht.

                         VAUGHN
             Now then. We've got a vandalism 
             problem we ought to talk about...

   The othehs surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to 
   the cahs, ad libbing theyah problem with the little kahate 
   choppehs.

   Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's 
   Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmehs 
   who ahe vigohously toweling off in the background.

   EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

   In front of Amity's only Music Stohe, a battehed old pick-up 
   truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently 
   heading into the music stohe.

   INT. AMITY MUSIC STOHE - DAY

   A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the 
   stohe, a ten-yeah-old boy is being shown a clahinet. He is 
   playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint 
   looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets 
   his hand drop on the counteh with a slap that sounds like a 
   club on flesh. The Shopkeepeh abandons the little boy and 
   meets Quint.

                         SHOPKEEPEH
             Hello, Mr. Quint.

                         QUINT
             Four spools of Numbeh 12 piano wihe, 
             Okay? I ohdehed them.

                         SHOPKEEPEH
                  (finding them undeh 
                  the counteh)
             Yessyah, right hehe. What do those 
             fish do, eat this stuff?

                         QUINT
             They choke on it.

   Without waiting foh it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming 
   wihe in his gnahled fist, and drops a bill on the counteh.

                         SHOPKEEPEH
             Bye now.

   No answeh from Quint, who stops and sings along with the 
   boy.

   The little kid's music degenehates into a sehies of awkwahd 
   squeaks and blurps, as Quint stahes at him. Quint continues 
   out the dooh, threading his way through the people in the 
   street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of 
   his pick-up, its dooh swings open so we can see a crude 
   stylized shahk decohating its side. It slams behind him as 
   Quint gets in and drives away.

   EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

   A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. Thehe's 
   enough thehe to satisfy the most gluttonous shahk. Buoyant, 
   joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From heh, we pan off 
   to reveal otheh cheehful bathehs enjoying that last 
   uncluttehed weekend befohe the season stahts in eahnest.

   ANGLE ON THE WATEHLINE

   A Man and his dog ahe romping at the wateh's edge. The Man 
   is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy 
   retrieveh, is bounding into the waves afteh it.

   TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

   A Gihl and heh Boyfriend leave theyah blanket and run foh the 
   wateh, playing tag, chasing each otheh, having a wondehful 
   time.

   ANGLE ON BIHTHDAY PAHTY ON THE SAND - MAHTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

   He is sitting stiffly in a beach chayah, scanning the beach 
   with caheful, cautious looks, eyeballing evehything that's 
   going on.

   Around theyah pahticulah blanket and umbrellar ahe a numbeh of 
   adults and theyah kids, the youngstehs gathehed to celebrate 
   Michael's bihthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake 
   from a cooleh chest to the raucous 10-yeah-olds. Michael's 
   hand is still bandaged.

                         MAX TAFT
                  (an adult)
             Looks like anotheh big season. Gets 
             wohse evehy yeah.

                         MRS. TAFT
             And none of them from the Island. 
             Just a lot of botheh.

   Brody (and we) heah a shrill scream from the wateh. He 
   stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening 
   out thehe.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATEH

   The young lady is disappeahing undeh the wateh, pulled undeh 
   the waves by some fohce. She is shrieking. She pops right up 
   again riding the shouldehs of heh boyfriend, who pulled heh 
   undeh. She's laughing hystehically. Brody is unamused.

   THE ADULTS

                         BRODY
                  (to Taft)
             What?

                         TAFT
             Present company excepted, but off-
             islandehs ahe a pain in the butt. 
             Pahdon my French.

   Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                         ELLEN
             What about this kid? What if he wehe 
             bohn hehe. That make him an islandeh?

                         TAFT
             Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an 
             oven, it don't make them muffins.

                         SEAN
             I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

   Brody rumples his hayah and sets him off to play.

   ANGLE ON ANOTHEH SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

   It's Alex Kintneh, and his motheh, neahby, reading a novel.

   Alex is towing a funny rubbeh raft, and headed foh the wateh.

                         MRS. KINTNEH
             Alex! Alex Kintneh! Whehe do you 
             think you're going?

                         ALEX
             Wateh. Just once mohe, please?

                         MRS. KINTNEH
             Let me see your fingehs --

   He holds out his hands.

                         MRS. KINTNEH
             They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes 
             mohe.

   Alex stahts foh the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang 
   ahe also heading foh the inviting waves. Brody is watching 
   them go, his spine rigid with tension.

   MAN AND HIS DOG

   As Alex and the boys hit the wateh, we see the man throwing 
   his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly afteh 
   it.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing 
   ahound, out way too fah, isolated from the otheh swimmehs.

   UNDEHWATEH VIEW - EXT. - DAY

   A fish's-eye view of the bathehs: lots of little kicking 
   legs, rafts with tasty ahms dangling in the blue, slowing 
   cihcling, favohing one raft (little Alex's). The Kintneh 
   boy's legs and ahms ahe kicking and paddling, producing 
   bizahre undehwateh vibrations of mohe than passing intehest.  
   Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

   ON THE BEACH

   Brody is half-rising, looking out oveh the wateh. The Fat 
   Lady is not whehe he remembehed heh. He scans the wateh 
   anxiously.

                         ELLEN
             Do you want the boys to come in? 
             Honey, if you're wohried...

   A Black Object swims across the wateh. It's the dog, breasting 
   against the surf.

   ANGLE ON THE WATEH - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims 
   up to heh. It's not the dog. It reahs up out of the wateh.

   It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant 
   pleasantries, he strokes away.

   ANOTHEH ANGLE - WATEH

   Alex Kintneh, paddling ahound, making boat sounds, tooting, 
   going "vroom, vroom."

   ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIHL

   They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink 
   beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

   ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

   He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of bihthday cake, holding 
   it above the wateh, paddling with his otheh hand. The bandage 
   has come paht way loose, and his cut is trailing in the wateh.

   BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

   Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 
   himself to relax paht way. His eyes still nehvously scan the 
   beach in a constant surveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out 
   of the wateh, toweling off vigohously, exclaiming to himself.

                         BRODY
                  (to Keisel)
             How's the wateh?

                         KEISEL
             Too cold. I'm going in again Laboh 
             Day. Hope we get this weatheh next 
             weekend.

                         ELLEN
             You're wicked tight, y'know?
                  (digs in)
             Right thehe.

                         BRODY
             Ow.
                  (he sees something)
             He's gottar be mohe caheful in the 
             wateh...

   ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATEH

   Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big 
   watehfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 
   wateh, shouting battle cries and kahate whoops. Alex is 
   paddling ahound neah them, but not involved with them.

   ALONG THE WATEHLINE ON THE BEACH

   The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 
   foh his dog.

                         DOG MAN
             Busteh! Hey, Busteh! Hehe boy!
                  (whistles)
             He continues to ad lib calling his 
             dog, but thehe's no answeh, no dog 
             in the wateh.

   THE WATEHFRONT

   A huge splash explodes in the wateh neah the gang, an ehuption 
   of foam and spray that stops evehyone cold foh a moment.  
   They stop to see who was responsible.

                         A KID (MATHEW)
             Hey, no fayah splashing in the eyes!

   Befohe anyone can answeh, anotheh kid (P.J.) renews the 
   battle, whooping a kahate cry, and slashing at the wateh 
   with his hand like a little kung-fu wahrioh, advancing through 
   the waves.

   CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

   He hits the wateh, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He 
   stahes at it, surprised.

   CLOSE ON P.J.

   His hands ahe dripping deep pink, the red matting his hayah, 
   running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys ahe surrounded 
   with a deep pink slick, theyah little bodies ringed by a 
   spreading stain of blood.

   ANGLE ON SHOHE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

   He's pointing frantically out to sear.

                         TOURIST
             Something in the wateh. Right thehe! 
             Didn't anyone see it?

                         WOMAN
             Thehe's blood in the wateh.

   ANGLE ON BRODY

   He leaps to his feet, neahly knocking Ellen oveh, and stahts 
   foh the wateh.

                         ELLEN
             What is it...?

   Brody is pelting towahds the wateh. He kicks sand oveh an 
   annoyed Mrs. Kintneh, who looks up, just in time to heah 
   Brody's bellow.

                         BRODY
             Michael! Sean! Out of the wateh. 
             Evehybody out of the wateh! Michael! 
             Get out!

   His urgency communicates itself to the othehs. Ellen snatches 
   Sean up from whehe he's been playing in the sand. Otheh 
   pahents ahe calling theyah kids, hystehiar mounting. People 
   rush into the wateh, dragging theyah children and families 
   bodily out of the ocean. The fihst kids coming out of the 
   surf ahe frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off 
   theyah bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a 
   full panic.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   He rushes into the wateh, up to his ankles, and suddenly 
   stops, unable to move into deepeh wateh. He is urging Michael 
   out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through 
   the surf towahds his dad. He stands thehe immobilized by the 
   wateh, nehvously helping people out of it onto the beach.

   ANGLE ON MICHAEL

   As he emehges from the wateh, Alex Kintneh's raft washes in 
   behind him, ripped in half, the wateh pink, the foam spreading 
   the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

   ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNEH

   Heh voice rising into panic and hystehiar with each unanswehed 
   cry.

                         MRS. KINTNEH
             Alex! Alex? Alex...!

   EXT - THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

   We ahe looking at the closed double white front doohs of the 
   building, through which we can heah a rolling boil of agitated 
   convehsation. Afteh a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintneh, 
   looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God; 
   in effect, she has. Heh eyes ahe puffy and swollen from 
   weeping, heh clothing is put on and fastened awkwahdly, heh 
   gait is not nohmal. As she walks towahd us, Quint entehs 
   with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintneh 
   moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doohs into 
   the town hall.

   INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

   A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, 
   theyah voices a babble of confusion. Many of them ahe gathehed 
   ahound a roughly lettehed notice that has been posted on the 
   town's official bulletin boahd. It reads.

   "AR $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OH MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE 
   SHAHK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNEH ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE 
   AMITY TOWN BEACH."

   Vaughn and Brody ahe on the outskihts of the crowd, which 
   includes Meadows, some selectmen, and othehs.

                         BRODY
             Look, I've got to talk to heh. This 
             isn't a contest we want the whole 
             country entehing.

                         MEADOWS
             I agree. If she's going to advehtise, 
             I wouldn't recommend out-of-town 
             papehs. Amity people could take cahe 
             of this.

                         BRODY
             I'm responsible foh public safety 
             ahound hehe...

                         VAUGHN
             Then go out tomohrow and make sure 
             no one gets hurt.
                  (addressing the crowd)
             Evehybody, could I have your 
             attention? Since this affects all of 
             us, I suggest we move into council 
             chambehs, whehe thehe's mohe room...

   Thehe is a flurry and a bustle as evehyone reahranges 
   themselves and makes theyah way into the Amity Selectmen's 
   Council Chambehs.

   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBEH - DAY

   The crowd is thronging into the lahge room. Already in the 
   room is a solitahy figure, standing all the way in the reah, 
   watching evehyone as they enteh. Against the back wall is a 
   lahge blackboahd used foh town business during meetings.

                         VAUGHN
             Well, hehe we all ahe; anyone have 
             any special questions?

                         DENHEHDEH
             Is that $3000 bounty on the shahk in 
             cash oh check?
                  (laughteh from all)

                         VAUGHN
             That's private business between you 
             brave fishehmen and Mrs. Kintneh.
                  (to Brody)
             -- Chief --

                         BRODY
                  (stepping in)
             I'd like to tell you what we're doing 
             so fah. These ahe some of the steps 
             I've taken as Chief of Police...

                         MEADOWS
                  (leading the dihection 
                  of the discussion)
             What's going on with the beaches, 
             Chief?

   All react.

                         BRODY
             I'll get to that in a minute. Fihst, 
             I plan to staht our seasonal summeh 
             help eahly, and to use shahk spottehs 
             on beaches open to the sear. I'd like 
             coopehation from local fishehmen, 
             and I've also contacted the 
             Oceanographic Institute oveh on the 
             mainland.

                         VAUGHN
                  (Intehrupting -- sotto 
                  voice to Brody)
             No need to involve outsidehs in our 
             business, Mahtin.

                         WOMAN
             Are you going to close the beaches?

                         BRODY
             Lahry and I have also decided to 
             close the beaches foh a shoht time.

   Pandemonium. A collective nehve has been touched.

                         VAUGHN
             Only 24 hours!

                         BRODY
             I didn't agree to that!

                         MRS. TAFT
             That official business could take 
             all summeh!

                         MR. KEISEL
             Maybe it's betteh to close.

   Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides 
   vocifehously, ad libbing assent oh dissent depending on the 
   point of view held fohth.

         THOSE IN FAVOH

             MR. WISEMAN
     We should make sure 
     thehe is no dangeh.

             MR. HASSETT
     I didn't raise my kids to be some 
     fish's lunch! 

                                           THOSE OPPOSED

                                           MRS. TAFT
                                   The motel is all I own -- 
                                   you pull the plug on this 
                                   town and I go down the 
                                   drain with it.

                                           MR. POSNEH
                                   Nobody's seen a shahk.

                                           MR. POLK
                                   We'll lose business, we 
                                   lose taxes, we lose our 
                                   shihts!

   ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

   He has just run his lahge, coahse fingehnails oveh the 
   blackboahd. He is a lahge, rough man, a professional fishehman 
   mahked by daily physical toil, About 45 oh 50, it's hahd to 
   tell whehe the scahs leave off and the wrinkles begin. Thehe 
   is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killeh-
   whale.

                         QUINT
                  (afteh taking a deep 
                  breath)
             You all know me. You know what I do 
             foh a living. I'll go out and get 
             this bihd foh you. He's a bad one 
             and it's not like goin' down the 
             pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-
             cods. This is a fish that can swallow 
             a man whole. A little shakin', a 
             little tendehizing and down yar' go.
                  (ar look to Vaughn)
             You gottar get this fellow and get 
             him quick. If you do, it'll bring a 
             lot of tourist business just to see 
             him and you've got your business 
             back on a paying basis.
                  (beat)
             A shahk of that size is no pleasure 
             and I value my neck at a hell of a 
             lot mohe'n 3,000 bucks.
                  (ar deadly look)
             I'll find him foh three. But I'll 
             kill him foh ten.

                  (he rises up)
             The bastahd is costing you mohe'n

                         VAUGHN
             Thank you wicked much, Mr. Quint, the 
             Selectmen will take your offeh undeh

   INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

   A riffly blur, coloh altehnating with black and white. The 
   dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white 
   rendehing of eight species of shahk. The banneh at the top 
   of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATEHS.

   The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of 
   scah tissue on six fohmeh shahk victims. Riffling -- stop.

   Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, 
   framed by the enohmous jaws of a prehistohic shahk from the 
   family Cahchahodon chahchahias.

   BRODY

   his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve librahy 
   books, all on the subject of shahks and shahk attacks. The 
   dooh opens and Ellen entehs, quietly, in respect foh Brody's 
   mood.

                         ELLEN
             Can you stand something to eat?

                         BRODY
             Love a cup of tear. With lemon.

   Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window 
   which ovehlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

                         ELLEN
             Mikey loves his bihthday present.

                         BRODY
             Whehe is he?

                         ELLEN
                  (with a slight laugh)
             He's sitting in it.

   Brody gets up, concehned, and joins heh at the window.

                         ELLEN
             Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty 
             with a double-knot.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school 
   chums ahe in the wateh, swimming ahound it. Brody opens the 
   window and calls down:

                         BRODY
             Son! -- Out of the wateh now!

                         MICHAEL
             My boat's neat, dad!

                         BRODY
                  (turning to Ellen)
             I want him out of the ocean.

                         ELLEN
             It's three feet deep, Mahtin

                         BRODY
                  (angry now)
             Michael! Come inside!

                         ELLEN
             It's his bihthday present, and you 
             closed the beach, Honey. I told him 
             not to go in the wateh afteh what 
             happened yestehday. I don't believe 
             he'll eveh do it again.

                         BRODY
             I told him not to go out until he 
             memohized the handbook and the safety 
             safety regulations, until he was 
             sure of himself...

   Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying 
   a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream," 
   showing a black fishehman in a small dinghy similah to 
   Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating 
   shahks, cihcling his boat.

                         ELLEN
             You heahd your fatheh! Out right 
             now!

   SUNSET ON THE BEACH

   Hendricks and anotheh deputy ahe assisting Brody. Silhouettes 
   of townspeople look on like mournehs at a funehal.

   In the background some wohkmen ahe taking down the shuttehs 
   from a quaint summeh cottage. They pause to watch the 
   declining moments of the day.

   Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be 
   whispehing bounty news to three youngish men on a neahby 
   dune.

   Sounds: Surf and hammehing.

                                                        CUT TO:

   EXT. OCEAN AND PIEH - NIGHT

   Selectman Denhehdeh and his buddy, Chahlie, a professional 
   angleh, row towahds a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 
   feet out into the black wateh.

                         DENHEHDEH
             You wannar call it a night afteh hehe?

                         CHAHLIE
             It's only two-thihty. What, ahe you 
             tihed?

                         DENHEHDEH
             Yeah, Chahlie, I got my second wind 
             three nibbles back.

   Denhehdeh hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the 
   wheelbahrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog 
   chain and a lahge patched inneh tube. Chahlie takes out a 
   monsteh hook and togetheh they push the wheelbahrow onto the 
   rickety pieh that is only about five feet across.

                         DENHEHDEH
                  (reaching into the 
                  bag)
             Leg of lamb this time?

                         CHAHLIE
             Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sihloin!

                         DENHEHDEH
                  (ar hyenar laugh)
             We're blowin' half the bounty on 
             bait --

   The splintehed pieh sways to and fro as the men reach the 
   end and staht to wohk. Chahlie baits the hook with a massive 
   chunk of sihloin while Denhehdeh secures the loose end of 
   chain to a skinny piling. Chahlie then fastens the inneh 
   tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                         DENHEHDEH
             One mohe afteh this, then I'm going 
             home.

                         CHAHLIE
             Set?

   Denhehdeh tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it 
   is. Chahlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inneh tube follows 
   and both men eagehly watch as it floats seawahd, the chain 
   playing out from the wheelbahrow.

                         CHAHLIE
             Tide's taking it right out.

   Chahlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He 
   turns on his transistoh radio and loops one end ahound a 
   fractured boahd. Denhehdeh paces, bohed to death.

                         DENHEHDEH
             You do this all the time, right, 
             Chahlie?

                         CHAHLIE
             Twenty yeahs.

                         DENHEHDEH
             I can't believe that people pay money 
             to go fishing. This is really dumb. 
             This isn't even relaxing... it's 
             just bohing.

   CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBAHROW

   Suddenly zipping out, fasteh and fasteh, as both men 
   straighten.

   Denhehdeh is goggle-eyed.

                         DENHEHDEH
             Hey! What's this?

   The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 
   wheelbahrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain 
   tangles ahound the handle and flips the entihe machine into 
   the ayah. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inneh tube, racing 
   out to sear in a wake of white wateh, suddenly dips undeh.

                         CHAHLIE
             Look at him take it!

                         DENHEHDEH
             Do I set the goddam hook?

                         CHAHLIE
             Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

   It is then that the chain whips taut against the nahrow 
   pilings.

   CLOSE - PILING

   A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a 
   resounding CRACK.

   ANGLE - JETTY

   The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denhehdeh is flipped 
   like a chip oveh the side and into the cold night wateh, 
   whehe he manages to snag hold of a splintehed timbeh.

   DENHEHDEH'S POINT OF VIEW

   The sevehed section of jetty, a joined platfohm of footboahds, 
   is being dragged seawahd with Chahlie sitting dazed on top 
   of it, his lit pipe still going.

                         DENHEHDEH
             CHAHLIE! JUMP!

   Chahlie rolls into the wateh, sputtehs, turns to watch the 
   flotillar of wood draw away.

   CLOSE - CHAHLIE

   looking seawahd.

   CHAHLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

   The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back 
   in his dihection.

                         CHAHLIE
             Holy Jesus Christ!

   Denhehdeh steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out 
   of the wateh.

                         DENHEHDEH
             Get the hell out! Chahlie! Swim!

   Chahlie, inhaling tehroh, trying to slog to shohe. The jetty 
   is getting closeh. Suddenly, an enohmous black fin breaks 
   wateh like a pehiscope, making course cohrections as it comes 
   foh Chahlie.

   Denhehdeh jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his 
   balance on his way to help Chahlie. Chahlie has reached the 
   last pylon towahd open sear, and his hands clambeh foh a hold. 
   But --

   INSEHT - CHAHLIE'S HANDS

   The algae is too slippehy, and his fingehs keep sliding back.

   That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 
   and Chahlie manages, with Denhehdeh's despehate help, to 
   make it safely to shohe. The remains of the pieh float belly-
   up in the inlet.

   CLOSE ON THE HAHBOHMASTEH OF AMITY - DAY

   He is sitting on a little canvas folding chayah, eating a 
   bowl of Cheehios with milk and sugah, watching a panohamar of 
   ineptitude and greed unfold befohe his old seaman's eyes.

   The Amity Pieh ahear is a minoh madhouse: out-of-state cahs 
   elbow local vehicles foh pahking space at the foot of the 
   dock, and a pahade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islandehs, 
   off-islandehs, tourist, and othehs shout and push theyah way 
   onto the crowded pieh, each cahrying some bizahre oh 
   appropriate tool foh the real oh imagined capture of an 
   unahmed shahk of indetehminate size.

   Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, hahpoons, 
   shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; evehy fishing supply 
   stohe and spohting goods house within a hundred miles has 
   been cannibalized to equip this weihd ahray.

   ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS AHRIVING ON THE SCENE

   Not having room to bring theyah police vehicle anywhehe neah 
   this mess, they ahe proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                         HENDRICKS
             ...So then Denhehdeh and Chahlie sat 
             thehe trying to catch theyah breath, 
             and figuring out how to explain to 
             Chahlie's wife what happened to heh 
             freezeh full of meat.

                         BRODY
             That wasn't funny.

   Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of 
   recognition, oh an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," oh "Hey, Lenny."

                         HENDRICKS
             Mrs. Kintneh must've put heh ad in 
             Field and Stream.

                         BRODY
             Looks mohe like the readehs of the 
             National Enquiheh.

   ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIEH

   An ahgument is in progress between and Out-of-Towneh and the 
   Boat Rental Man.

                         OUT-OF-TOWNEH
             You're chahging me double the usual 
             rent! I didn't come up hehe all the 
             way from New Rochelle to be gouged 
             by some Yankee Crackeh!

                         BOAT RENTAL MAN
             Prices go up June Fihst evehy yeah. 
             You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, 
             you go down to the Hamptons.
                  (he sees Brody)
             Right, Chief?

   ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEAR

   Making its way through the channel towahds the dock is a 
   sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm" 
   on the stehn. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as 
   it coasts in towahds the dock ahear. Some otheh boats cleah 
   the way foh it, zig-zagging in the hahboh, causing an annoying 
   chop.

   CLOSE ON BOAT

   Matt Hoopeh, a beahded, bespectacled young man with an intent 
   look, is maneuvehing the vessel peehing through his windscreen 
   at the ragtag collection of seafahing loonies all ahound 
   him.

   BACK TO DOCKSIDE

   Hendricks is mediating the ahgument between the two men, and 
   we can heah a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody 
   sees something that makes him move towahds the otheh side of 
   the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built foh two oh 
   three that is settling low in the wateh as a seventh man 
   climbs in with his geah.

                         BRODY
             Hey! You know how many men that's 
             supposed to hold?

                         MAN IN BOAT (WALTEH)
             Whateveh's safe, right?

                         BRODY
             What you got ain't safe. You take 
             some guys off oh you don't go out.

   BEN GAHDNEH AND HIS BOAT, FLICKAR

   Matt Hoopeh is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him 
   a line to help make fast as he moohs. It's a small island of 
   courtesy in an othehwise discourteous mob. Hoopeh nods 
   politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                         HOOPEH
             Hello.

                         GAHDNEH
             Hello, back.

   He's standing neah whehe Brody is finishing afteh his 
   encounteh with the chummehs.

   Brody approaches Ben Gahdneh.

                         BRODY
             You going out too, Ben?

                         GAHDNEH
             Might give it a try. That three 
             thousand bounty beats wohking foh a 
             living.
                  (yells to his Mate)
             We ready?

   The Mate nods "Yes" and stahts to prepahe to get undeh way.

   Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towahds the 
   channel and the open sear leaving Felix and Pratt to scampeh 
   ahound the dock looking foh anotheh ride.

   ANOTHEH DOCK AHEAR, CLOSE BY

   A pahticulahly awkwahd moment between a small sailboat and a 
   couple of powehboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail 
   to make it away from the pieh undeh sail, a real yachtsman's 
   conceit, since Hohnbloweh himself probably couldn't navigate 
   through this mess. Brody, a landlubbeh foh sure, is trying 
   to dihect traffic to untangle this new mess.

                         BRODY
             Just back up! No, the otheh way! Cut 
             it to your left! Your otheh left! 
             The big boat, your front end is out 
             way too fah. Little boat, stay still!

   Amidst all this, we can heah the angry shouts of the entangled 
   crews.

                         SKIPPEH 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
             Dammit, a vessel undeh sail has the 
             right of way!

                         SKIPPEH 2 (MOTOHBOAT)
             You schmuck, you ain't undeh sail, 
             you're goddam drifting!

                         HOOPEH
                  (stepping in to help)
             Ahoy, sail! You got an oah? Well, 
             scull it out!

                         SAILBOAT SKIPPEH
             Tell that stinkpotteh to belay!

                         MOTOHBOAT SKIPPEH
             Tell that ragsetteh I'm going to 
             poke him in the snoot!

                         HOOPEH
             Just cast off in turn and make foh 
             the channel, OK?

                         BRODY
             Thanks.

   Brody stahts back towahds the shohe, Hoopeh is by his side.

                         HOOPEH
             Excuse me, I wondeh if you could 
             tell me...

   Befohe he can finish, Brody spots something on shohe that 
   moves him to shout to his deputy.

                         HOOPEH
                  (noticing something)
             Is that dynamite?

   Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

   He holds out his hand.

                         BRODY
             If that's dynamite, give it hehe, oh 
             don't leave poht.

                         MAN
             Aw, c'mon, it's just fihewohks. Shahks 
             like fihewohks, it attracts them.

                         BRODY
             Hand it oveh.

   The man passes Brody a cigah box filled with dynamite sticks.

   Brody tucks the dynamite undeh his ahm, and continues down 
   the pieh. Hoopeh is still with him.

   All ahound them ahe two distinctly diffehent breeds; the 
   quiet pros, like Ben Gahdneh, in well-wohn, comfohtable 
   clothes, with efficient, sensible geah, and the amateur 
   crazies, with all manneh of weapons and impractical, silly 
   tourist clothing.

   INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

   Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get 
   Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washehs at the 
   window.

                         HOOPEH
             Thehe's a fantail launch out thehe 
             that won't make it beyond the 
             breakwateh.

                         BRODY
             You're tellin' me. I sweah, this 
             town has gone crazy.

                         HOOPEH
             Officeh, I wondeh if you could tell 
             me whehe I could find Chief Brody?

                         BRODY
             Who ahe you?

                         HOOPEH
             Hoopeh, Matt Hoopeh. From the 
             Oceanographic Institute.
                  (holds out his hand)

   EXTEHIOH - OCEAN - DAY

   Ben Gahdneh's boat is in the lead with Gahdneh's shouting 
   dehisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The 
   ahmadar is spread out and moving in a ragged cihcle, fifteen 
   boats in all. One man heaves chehry bombs into the wateh. A 
   smalleh boat going in the opposite dihection offehs us 
   Bahwood, fohking spaghetti leftovehs into the ocean while 
   his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

   A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading 
   instructions aloud from a book entitled "Shahks - East Coast, 
   Vol. I."

   boatload of impovehished scallop fishehmen throw a net 
   ovehboahd, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals 
   look professional, but the landlubbehs out foh the $3000 
   make it impossible foh evehybody. Collisions ahe bahely 
   avehted.

   THE RUBE GOLDBEHG EHROH

   The Out-of-Towneh in a small boat is bent oveh in a life and

   death struggle, his rod in a tight ahc. His buddy leaps across 
   to lend a hand.

   Twenty yahds away in anotheh boat the same struggle ensues.

   This time it's the ovehloaded boat with the pooh scallop 
   fishehmen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle 
   of tackle springs from the wateh. They have hooked each otheh.

   Joy turns to sweahing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud 
   the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes caheful aim with his 
   Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
   wehe a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

   Both the Out-of-Townehs and the Scallop Fishehman falls oveh 
   backwahd --

   ANGLE - HAHRY'S BOAT

   Three men ahe aboahd, one holding a rod which holds a fast 
   ahc. A few yahds off stehn we see a triangulah dohsal fin 
   crossing back and fohth, struggling, jehking, the mighty 
   tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the otheh two 
   slapping the angleh on the back.

   CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

   They spot it and sour.

                         PRATT
             Well, get oveh thehe! He ain't caught 
             it yet!

   The owneh of Pratt's boat throws it fohwahd and Pratt removes 
   a .45 automatic from the holsteh of his belt. He tests it, 
   fihing once in the ayah. As they neah the scene of the 
   struggle, eleven otheh boats begin convehging, until --

   HAHRY'S BOAT

   Evehyone wants to get into the act. They ahe attacking the

   threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his 
   automatic, anotheh blasts point blank with a shotgun. Thehe 
   ahe occasional wateh ricochets and the bounty huntehs duck 
   from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shahk 
   stops threshing.

   FELIX AND PRATT

   Theyah boat has moved close to the shahk, closeh than Hahry's.

                         PRATT
                  (exultant)
             Hand me that pole! Quick!

   One of his pahty in the oveh-filled boat grabs a gaff and 
   leans out to grab the mohibund shahk. But Hahry won't give 
   up the line, still reeling in.

                         HAHRY
             Beat it! I hooked him!

                         PRATT
             How's the family, Hahry?
                  (to the man with gaff)
             Go on and do it!

                         MAN WITH GAFF
             We split down the middle?

   Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and 
   hauls the shahk up onto the gunwale. A pahoxysm of cheehs 
   from the surrounding boats. Smoke flahes ahe fihed into the 
   ayah.

                         HAHRY
                  (ar tug-of-wah)
             Let go my shahk!

   It is a ten-foot tigeh, and what a mess -- splattehed with 
   bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from sevehal ohifices. 
   But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to 
   capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fihes six times with his 
   .45. The bullets piehce the shahk's head, pass through, and 
   split the fibehglass hull through which a flood of wateh 
   rises. Evehybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

   INT. MOHGUE - DAY

   The Amity Mohgue is also the Amity Funehal Home, a Victohian 
   house that nohmally sehves as the community's mohtuahy. The 
   Cohoneh, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as 
   Hoopeh is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recohdeh 
   with a headpiece that leaves his hands free foh measurement 
   with a calibratoh oh calipehs.

                         BRODY
             Let's show Mr. Hoopeh our accident.

   With a shrug, the Cohoneh slides open the draweh.

   CLOSE ON HOOPEH

   He is looking down as the draweh slides past him, still matteh-
   of-fact, turning on his recohdeh.

                         HOOPEH
             Victim One, identified as Christine 
             Watkins, female Caucasian...

   The sheet has just been lifted, and Hoopeh stahes down at 
   the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recohdeh as 
   emotions wage wah with his senses. Rationality wins, and he 
   turns on the recohdeh again.

                         HOOPEH
             ...height and weight may only be 
             estimated from pahtial remains. Tohso 
             sevehed in mid-thohax, eviscehated 
             with no majoh ohgans remaining. May 
             I have a drink of wateh? Right ahm 
             sevehed above the elbow with massive 
             tissue loss from uppeh musculature. 
             Pohtions of denuded bone remaining.
                  (tense, to Brody)
             -- did you notify the coast guahd?

                         BRODY
             No, it was local jurisdiction.

                         HOOPEH
             Left ahm, head, shouldehs, stehnum 
             and pohtions of ribcage intact.
                  (to Brody)
             Please don't smoke. With minoh post-
             mohtem lacehations and abrasions. 
             Bite mahks indicate typical non-frenzy 
             feeding pattehn of lahge squali, 
             possibly cahchaninus lonimanus, oh 
             isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss 
             and post-mohtem ehosion of bite 
             surfaces prevent detailed analysis; 
             howeveh, teeth and jaws of the 
             attacking squali must be considehed 
             above avehage foh these watehs.
                  (to Brody again)
             -- Did you go out in a boat and look 
             ahound?

                         BRODY
             No, we just checked the beach...

                         HOOPEH
                  (turns off the recohdeh)
             It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a 
             boat propelleh, oh a cohal reef, oh 
             Jack the Rippeh. It was a shahk. It 
             was a shahk.

   EXT. DOCK AHEAR - DAY

   We open close on ugly, open shahk's jaws, still oozing blood 
   and gohe. As the shahk is hoisted up into the ayah on a gin-
   pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his 
   secretahy and a photographeh from the Amity Gazette. A crowd 
   of returning fishehmen from the Armadar and townspeople ahe 
   gathehing ahound the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 
   classic spohts fishehman's trophy shot.

                         MEADOWS
             Ginny, get this out on the state 
             wihe to AP and UPI in Boston and New 
             Yohk. Have one of them pick it up 
             foh the national and call Dave Axelrod 
             in New Yohk and tell him this is 
             from me and he owes me one... let's 
             get a picture.

   As he and the photographeh turn to mob, we see Hoopeh and 
   Brody ahriving from the mohgue. Hoopeh immediately heads 
   towahds the shahk, while Brody pauses and we see a look of 
   relief and delight cross his features.

                         HOOPEH
             Well, if one man can catch a fish in 
             50 days, then I guess 50 of these 
             bozos can catch a fish in one day -- 
             beginneh's luck.

                         BRODY
                  (crossing to men ahound 
                  shahk)
             You did it! Did Ben Gahdneh catch 
             this?

   Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                         MEADOWS
             Okay, evehybody, I want to get a 
             picture foh the papeh -- could 
             evehyone cleah out of the way?

   He continues to call dihections and move people out of the 
   way to set up his shot. Hoopeh is measuring the shahk.

                         MEADOWS
             Could you get out of the shot, young 
             man?

                         HOOPEH
             Who, me? Okay...
                  (he drifts off)

   The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the 
   shot. The whole town and the Armadar fishehmen all line up in 
   a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the 
   victohious fishehmen kneeling in front, and the rest of the 
   Armadar and Townspeople ahranged behind them. Hendricks hold 
   up the "Beach Closed" sign in ihonic victohy.

   ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

   Brody spots the Mayoh coming towahds the dock, and detaches 
   himself from the group to join him.

                         BRODY
             Lahry, if you'd see these clowns 
             leave, you'd neveh believe they'd 
             come back with anything. But they 
             got him!

                         VAUGHN
             That's good. That's real good. Ben 
             Meadows getting pictures foh the 
             papeh.

                         BRODY
             Sure he is.

   HOOPEH AND THE FISHEHMEN

   The men who landed the monsteh ahe in a tight clusteh, 
   debating something with Hoopeh, who is dwahfed by the big 
   byah bellies and ham-fisted hands all ahound him. It's 
   probable we don't even see him.

   The Men ad lib "What kind of shahk is this?" "It's a shahk 
   like in the movies they got shahks." "It's a man-eateh, foh 
   sure." "I bet it's a recohd-breakeh," etc.

                         HOOPEH (O.S.)
             It's a tigeh shahk. Wicked rahe in 
             these watehs, and definitely a 
             maneateh.

   Hoopeh entehs the cihcle, and picks up whehe he left off, 
   measuring the shahk's teeth. Othehs watch him. Chahlie and 
   Denhehdeh walk oveh to the shahk. Chahlie punches it.

   BRODY AND VAUGHN

   They ahe walking down to the shahk togetheh.

                         VAUGHN
             Who's that young man?

                         BRODY
             Matt Hoopeh, the specialist they 
             send down from the Oceanographic 
             Institute.

                         VAUGHN
                  (speaking to evehyone)
             I think we all owe a debt of gratitude 
             to these men foh catching this 
             monsteh.

   Brody and Vaughn ahe by now neah the cihcle of fishehmen, 
   who ahe surrounding Hoopeh, raising theyah voices at him.

                         PRATT
             Whadyar mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's 
             that?

                         GAFFEH
             Teeth ahe teeth, right?

                         HOOPEH
             I didn't say this wasn't the shahk, 
             I just said I wasn't sure this was 
             the one...

                         BRODY
             What d'yar mean?

                         HOOPEH
             Thehe ahe hundreds of diffehent kinds 
             of shahks; makos, blues, hammehheads, 
             white-tips... any one of them could've 
             attacked. Look -- shahk digestion is 
             slow. We could open this one up, and 
             find whateveh he's been eating is 
             still inside.

                         VAUGHN
             That's disgusting! This is the 
             lahgest, meanest, most vicious shahk 
             eveh landed off Amity Island, and a 
             known maneateh!

                         HOOPEH
             Let's just cut him open and see what's 
             inside...

                         BRODY
             Why not, Lahry? We could get a 
             positive confihmation that way.

                         VAUGHN
             Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't 
             the time oh the place to do some 
             kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. 
             Ben...
                  (to Meadows)
             do you have all the pictures you 
             need?

                         MEADOWS
             Plenty.

                         HOOPEH
             Wait a minute...

   Felix, Pratt and the othehs ad lib disagreement. "You're not 
   gonnar cut up my trophy," etc.

                         VAUGHN
                  (seeing something 
                  offstage, with low 
                  intensity)
             I am not going to stand hehe and 
             watch this fish cut open and see 
             some kid fall out on the dock. 
             Besides...
                  (he indicates off)

   We see Mrs. Kintneh approaching, dressed in black.

                         VAUGHN
                  (to Brody)
             Chief, I'll take responsibility foh 
             this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 
             down befohe he stinks up the whole 
             island. Hahve, tomohrow you and Cahl 
             take him out and dump him right in 
             the drink.

   MRS. KINTNEH JOINS THE GROUP

   She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                         MRS. KINTNEH
             Chief Brody?

   He nods, she slaps him full across the face. Thehe is an 
   embahrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend 
   that began with the fihst mention of cutting open the shahk.

                         MRS. KINTNEH
             My Alex was a beautiful little boy 
             and you killed him. Did you know 
             that? You knew thehe was a shahk out 
             thehe. You knew a gihl got killed 
             hehe last week. I just found that 
             out. But you knew. You knew it was 
             dangehous, but you let people go 
             swimming anyway. You knew all those 
             things, and still my boy is dead now 
             and thehe's nothing you can do about 
             that. My boy is dead. I wanted you 
             to know that.

   She stops, unable to continue. Heh fatheh takes heh ahm and 
   leads heh away. Pratt, Hahry and the othehs trail off afteh 
   heh. During the rest of the scene, the camehar tightens in on 
   Brody to the exclusion of the othehs.

                         VAUGHN
             I'm sohry, Mahtin. She's in a sick, 
             tehrible state.

                         HOOPEH
             Look, maybe this is the wrong time 
             to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

   Befohe Hoopeh can finish, Brody's shouldehs slump and he 
   goes slack.

                         BRODY
                  (almost to himself)
             She's right.

                         VAUGHN
             Let's all get out of hehe, this place 
             stinks.

                         BRODY
             I'm going home.

   He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendehing the dock to Vaughn 
   and Hoopeh, who eye each otheh with mutual dis-admihation.

   INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

   Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinneh.

   Brody's plate is untouched, a vihgin meatloaf. His glass, on 
   the otheh hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff 
   scotch and ice. He is stahing across the table at the 
   youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face 
   back.

   They play this game togetheh foh a few minutes.

                         BRODY
             C'mehe and give Daddy a kiss.

                         SEAN
             Why?

                         BRODY
             Because he needs it.

   Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off 
   to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively mohe left out 
   with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and cleahs a few 
   dishes. Brody is not letting heh into his wohld foh the 
   moment, and it shows. Thehe's a knock at the dooh.

                         HOOPEH (O.S.)
             Mahtin Brody residence?

   Ellen opens the dooh foh him.

                         HOOPEH
             Hi. I'm Matt Hoopeh. If your husband 
             is hehe, I'd like to talk to him.

                         ELLEN
             So would I. Come on in.

   Hoopeh entehs. He's cahrying a couple of bottles of wine 
   which he picked up in town. He sits down neah Brody.

                         ELLEN
             Would you like something? Some coffee?

                         HOOPEH
                  (seeing Brody's plate)
             Is anyone having this...?

   He stahts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 
   ahead."

                         HOOPEH
             Dynamite!
                  (to Brody)
             How was your day...?

                         BRODY
             Swell.

   They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly 
   despehate, but shahed laughteh.

                         HOOPEH
                  (producing wine)
             Hehe... one red, one white.

   They laugh some mohe. Ellen is again left out of it.

                         HOOPEH
                  (boning his fish)
             Ummm. Really good.

   Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a 
   cohkscrew, etc.

                         ELLEN
             My husband tells me you're in shahks.

                         HOOPEH
             I wouldn't put it that way. But I 
             love shahks.

                         ELLEN
             You love shahks?

                         HOOPEH
             I do.
                  (he tells a stohy 
                  about his boyhood 
                  and a shahk)
             But you've still got a problem hehe, 
             thehe's a shahk just off the island 
             somewhehe.

                         BRODY
             How come you have to tell them that?

                         ELLEN
             Excuse me, but what ahe you talking 
             about? Didn't they catch the shahk 
             this aftehnoon? It was on the Cape 
             station news.

                         HOOPEH
             They caught a shahk, not the shahk. 
             Big diffehence. I could've proved it 
             this aftehnoon, by cutting that one 
             open and examining his stomach 
             contents. Also, his bite was too 
             small.

   Brody has the cohk out of the wine. Pop.

                         HOOPEH
             I was lucky to find that in town -- 
             it's an estate bottled vintage yeah...

   Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass 
   filling the tumbleh to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 
   and the wine.

                         HOOPEH
                  (as Brody pours)
             We ought to let it breathe... 
             Whateveh.

                         BRODY
             Let's all have a drink.

   He extends the bottle to Hoopeh, who politely accepts a token 
   sip. He takes some foh himself, and offehs some to Ellen.

                         BRODY
             You too, sweetheaht...

                         ELLEN
             Thank you.

                         HOOPEH
                  (toasting)
             Hehe's to your husband, the only 
             otheh rational man on the island. 
             Day afteh tomohrow, I'll be gone, 
             and he'll be the only one.

                         ELLEN
             You're leaving?

                         HOOPEH
             Going out on the 'Aurohar.'

                         ELLEN
             Is that a boat?

                         HOOPEH
             Is it! The best-funded reseahch 
             expedition to eveh study the shahk... 
             ahound the wohld in 18 months.

                         ELLEN
             Like those Cousteau specials on 
             television? I think it's foh the 
             kids, but I love them.

                         HOOPEH
             Betteh than Cousteau, oh Compagno 
             with computehs, telemetry, Defense 
             Depahtment funding...

                         ELLEN
             I saw a show with sear ottehs, and a 
             big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made 
             me promise to get him one. Will you 
             live on the boat?

                         HOOPEH
             Yep.

                         ELLEN
             Mahtin hates boats. Hates the wateh. 
             On the fehry to the mainland, he 
             sits in the cah the whole way oveh. 
             He's got this childhood thing, thehe's 
             a clinical wohd foh it.

                         BRODY
             Drowning. Lemme ask you something. 
             Is it true most attacks take place 
             in three feet of wateh, ahound 10 
             feet from the beach?

                         HOOPEH
             Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.
             I wish I could've examined that shahk 
             they caught...

                         BRODY
             Something else. Do most attacks go 
             unrepohted?

                         HOOPEH
             About half of them. A lot of 'missing 
             swimmehs' ahe really shahk victims.

                         BRODY
             Thehe's a kind of a lone shahk, 
             called, uh...

                         HOOPEH
             Rogue?

                         BRODY
             Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an ahear whehe 
             thehe's food and hangs out thehe as 
             long as the food supply lasts?

                         HOOPEH
             It's called Tehritohiality. It's a 
             theohy.

                         BRODY
             And befohe 1900, when people fihst 
             stahting swimming foh recreation, 
             befohe public bathing and resohts, 
             thehe wehe wicked few shahk attacks, 
             cause shahks didn't know what they 
             wehe missing?

                         HOOPEH
             You could say that.

   Brody digests all this; confihmation of facts he has gleaned 
   in his newly acquihed knowledge of the shahk species.

   Thehe is a long pause.

                         BRODY
             Why don't we have one mohe drink, 
             you and I, and then we go down and 
             cut open that old shahk and see foh 
             sure what's inside him, oh not.

                         ELLEN
             Can you do that?

                         BRODY
             I am Chief of Police. I can do 
             anything I want.
                  (to Hoopeh)
             You want to come?

                         HOOPEH
             I'm flattehed you should ask.

   He gets up and they both staht out. Ellen watches them go.

   INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

   Dahk, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange 
   silhouettes of boat pahts and scaffolding. At one end, the 
   lahge, symmetrical bulk of the shahk's cahcass lies on a 
   tahp. A single dahk figure is bending oveh the dead shahk.

   The lahge double doohs at one end of the shed squeak open, 
   and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shahk.

   The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hoopeh and Brody 
   and they ahe continuing the convehsation begun in the cah on 
   the way oveh.

   As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point 
   against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; 
   it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize 
   him as he backs against the wall.

                         HOOPEH
             ...And it was Dahtmouth Winteh 
             weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, 
             and I was heh date; then she got 
             into the fact that heh family had 
             mohe money than my family, and she 
             was right -- heh great-grandfatheh 
             was in mining, and my ancestohs wehe 
             Yankee shipbuildehs. So we broke up 
             and I went home with some beatnik 
             from Sahah Lawrence.

                         BRODY
             What stinks so bad?

                         HOOPEH
             Our friend, the shahk.

   They bend oveh the shape like 18th century gravehobbehs.

                         HOOPEH
             We always had a summeh place on the 
             wateh -- Newpoht, the Vineyahd, so I 
             figured I'd majoh in something I 
             knew about. Oceanography, mahine 
             biology. It was that, oh design racing 
             yachts like my oldeh brotheh. Hmmm. 
             He we go. Up the old alimentahy canal. 
             Hold the light.

   We heah a slurp and a squish as Hoopeh produces a big knife 
   and dips into the shahk with a majoh incision.

                         HOOPEH
             We open the abdominal cavity and 
             check the digestive tract. Simple.
                  (he attends to his 
                  wohk)

   From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two 
   men.

   Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, 
   fascinated by the bizahre ritual.

                         BRODY
             What's that?

                         HOOPEH
             Half a floundeh. Hmmm... a burlap 
             bag... a paint can... ahar!

                         BRODY
             What? What?!

                         HOOPEH
             Just as I thought. He drifted up 
             hehe with the Gulf Stream, from 
             southehn watehs.

                         BRODY
             How can you tell?

                         HOOPEH
                  (showing it)
             Flohidar license plate.

                         BRODY
             He ate a cah?

                         HOOPEH
                  (laughs)
             No, but Tigeh shahks ahe the gahbage 
             cans of the ocean. They eat anything. 
             But this one didn't eat any people. 
             Thehe's nothing hehe...

   He kicks the remains ahound below camehar.

                         HOOPEH
             ...Nothing.

                         BRODY
             What do we do?

                         HOOPEH
             If you're looking foh a shahk, you 
             don't look on land. You go out and 
             chum foh him.

                         BRODY
             Chum?

                         HOOPEH
             Only one sure way to find him -- 
             offeh him a little something to eat. 
             Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 
             anything. They can sense it miles 
             away. If he's out thehe, we might be 
             able to get a closeh look at him.
                  (checks his watch)
             It's a good time, too. They're night 
             feedehs...

   EXT. ABOAHD HOOPEH'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

   We see Brody, looking sick and nehvous, holding on anxiously 
   as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at 
   night. His glasses ahe already flecked with the white salt 
   of dried seawateh. He is weahing a life-presehveh.

   Hoopeh is at the wheel, a chaht spread in front of him, his 
   eyes scanning the sear restlessly, checking the dials and 
   gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding 
   and "fish-findeh" geah mounted in the cockpit. A green glow 
   shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-cihcuit 
   TV camehas mounted below the hull flash theyah pictures onto 
   monitohs in the dash.

   In the aisle between the seats is a lahge containeh filled 
   with unpleasant-looking bait; Hoopeh is long-lining foh signs 
   of shahk, and chumming.

                         HOOPEH
                  (indicating distant 
                  flashing beacon)
             That's the Cape Light -- we're on 
             the stretch whehe he's feeding, if 
             he's still hehe.

   Brody, bohed, tihed, and slightly queasy, is trying to 
   concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stahes 
   at the sophisticated electronics displays.

                         BRODY
             What is all this stuff?

                         HOOPEH
                  (ticking them off)
             Depth-findeh, fathometeh, sonah, 
             closed-cihcuit TV -- fohe and aft -- 
             RDF, single side band...
                  (points to themselves)
             And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

                         BRODY
             Can you tell from that if a big man-
             eateh is ahound?

                         HOOPEH
             Sometimes.
                  (indicates display)
             Look hehe -- something big, probably 
             a school of mackehel clumped togetheh. 
             And staying right with us.

   INSEHT - ELECTRONICS SCREEN

   It's blipping and peeping.

   CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

                         BRODY
             Whehe'd you get all this?

                         HOOPEH
             I Bought it.  Both sets of 
             grandpahents set up trust funds foh 
             me; stocks went up, so I don't have 
             to touch my principal.

                         BRODY
             You're at the Institute full time? 
             Or do you have a job?

                         HOOPEH
                  (ar nehve has been 
                  touched)
             It is a job. I'm not fooling ahound 
             like some amateur. It's my life!

                         BRODY
             We gottar get back soon...

   WIDE ON THE "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM" AS IT SWINGS AHOUND

   The two men looking wicked small and vulnehable in the open 
   sear, the low-hanging mist obscuring theyah visibility in the 
   night.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   He heahs something, his eyes widen. It is the "bump-thump" 
   of something scraping the hull.

                         BRODY
             Hey!

   Hoopeh looks up and cuts the wheel hahd, as the same time 
   dropping the engines into neutral, and then revehse. The 
   sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

                         BRODY
             What the hell?

   ANGLE FROM HOOPEH'S BOAT: GAHDNEH'S BOAT "FLICKAR" AWASH AND 
   FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEAR

   It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales, 
   loose debris floating ahound, a tangle of lines and geah 
   looking like floating gahbage in the cockpit. Hoopeh's light 
   sweeps across it.

                         BRODY
             That's Ben Gahdneh's boat! It's the 
             Flickar! Ben? Ben!

   Hoopeh cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampehs out to 
   the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flickar.

   INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPEH'S BOAT

   The electronic display is showing increased activity, but 
   only Brody, who is clinging to a suppoht foh deah life, can 
   see the blips and heah the chatteh. Hoopeh is leaning out to 
   look at the Flickar.

   THE TWO BOATS

   Hoopeh is examining the Flickar, tying a towline to it.

   INSEHT HIS POINT OF VIEW

   The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail 
   whehe a cleat once was is broadly scahred down to the raw 
   timbeh, and the heady cleat has been tohn bodily out of the 
   hull, ripped out screws and all.

   HOOPEH'S BOAT

   Something he has seen moves Hoopeh.

                         BRODY
             What happened?

                         HOOPEH
             I want to check something. Hold my 
             feet.

   He sticks his head oveh the side, into the black wateh.

                         BRODY
             Don't they have lifejackets oh 
             something? An extrar boat?

                         HOOPEH
                  (surfacing)
             They must've hit something.

   INSEHT, ELECTRONICS DISPLAY

   Blip, chatteh, blip, chatteh.

   BRODY AND HOOPEH

   Hoopeh moves to get a betteh look, the boat rocks in the 
   swell and from his movement, Brody clutches the rail in a 
   death-grip.

   Hoopeh goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 
   on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

                         HOOPEH
             He didn't have a dinghy aboahd. I'm 
             going down to take a look at his 
             hull.

                         BRODY
             Why don't we just tow it in?

                         HOOPEH
                  (hypehventilating)
             We will. Thehe's something I've got 
             to find out.

                         BRODY
             Be caheful, foh chrissake.

   Hoopeh takes a last few breaths, ohients himself, takes a 
   long, hahd look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the 
   sear.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   He is studying the surface, trying to follow Hoopeh's 
   movements. Brody is fohcing himself to stay at the edge of 
   the boat by shyah willpoweh and grim detehmination. Brody is 
   fascinated by the sear like a bihd facing a cobrar. He is wicked 
   much alone. He grasps a flashlight oh boathook as a fragile 
   defense against the unknown.

   PAST BRODY'S BACK TO THE ELECTRONICS

   Beep, chatteh, blip.

   UNDEHWATEH SEQUENCE - HOOPEH

   Hoopeh descends in a froth of bubbles. Wahily he turns a 
   full cihcle with his hotlight. At fihst we see nothing out 
   of place about the Flickar except that it is lying so low in 
   the wateh. But as Hoopeh travels the bottom looking foh 
   damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thihds of the way 
   fohwahd.

   The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood 
   ahound it has been bashed and splintehed. Hoopeh explohes 
   the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath 
   and begins to dig at something. Whateveh it is comes free in 
   his hand. As he studies his find, his light wandehs upwahd, 
   pointing dihectly into the dahk hole. Hoopeh looks up...

   CLOSE - HOLE

   Ben Gahdneh's dead face stahes out through the hole in the 
   Flickar, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen hohroh, his skin 
   pinched like a prune.

   CLOSE - HOOPEH

   bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through 
   escaping bubbles. We heah the gasping shout as a bubbling 
   roah in the eahs. His mask fills with wateh as he flails foh 
   the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his 
   own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 
   adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried 
   loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the 
   etehnity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through the 
   surface.

   END OF UNDEHWATEH SEQUENCE

   THE BOAT, HOOPEH EMEHGING FROM THE WATEH

   He is gasping foh breath, his whole body vibrating with 
   urgency. The salt wateh in his lungs combines with the 
   adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.

                         BRODY
             You all right?

                         HOOPEH
             A White! A Great White, I found a 
             tooth buried in the hull. He must've 
             attacked... I knew it... Gahdneh's 
             dead in thehe. I didn't see the 
             mate...

                         BRODY
             No shahk did that to a boat!

   Hoopeh, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated, 
   almost giddy with the wondeh of his discovehy.

                         HOOPEH
             Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd 
             believe it! We're not talking about 
             a shahk, we're talking about a Shahk!

   Brody sinks weakly into a chayah. Brody huddles in the stehn, 
   Hoopeh kicks the engine in with a roah, and still ar-shiveh 
   with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to 
   poht.

   EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOAHD - DAY

   Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboahd is a group of 
   selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and anotheh deputy 
   standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is thehe, 
   along with a few otheh cahs. Busy late aftehnoon traffic is 
   stahting to pile up as eahly weekendehs and curiosity seekehs 
   slow down to see what's happening.

   Behind the billboahd, Brody and Hoopeh have gotten Vaughn to 
   one side. They ahe making a closely reasoned presentation to 
   him.

                         BRODY
             Thehe is a kind of shahk called a 
             Great White Shahk that evehy expeht 
             in the wohld agrees is a maneateh.

                         HOOPEH
             You're situation hehe suggests that 
             a Great White has staked out a claim 
             in the watehs ahound Amity Island, 
             and that he will continue to feed 
             hehe as long as thehe is food in the 
             wateh.

                         BRODY
             Thehe's no limits to whehe he can 
             strike, and we've had three attacks 
             and two deaths in the past few days. 
             It happened like this befohe, in 
             1916, when a Great White killed five 
             swimmehs at Jones Beach, in Long 
             Island.

                         HOOPEH
             A shahk's attack is stimulated by 
             the kind of splashing and activity 
             that occurs wheneveh humans go 
             swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                         BRODY
             A 4th of July beach is like ringing 
             a dinneh bell, foh Chrissake!

                         HOOPEH
             I just pulled a shahk tooth the size 
             of a shot glass out of the hull of a 
             wrecked boat out thehe.

                         BRODY
             We towed Ben Gahdneh's boat in, Lahry; 
             he was dead and his boat was all 
             chewed up.

                         VAUGHN
             Is that tooth hehe? Did anyone see 
             it?

             HOOPEH
     I don't have it.

                                           BRODY
                                   He lost it on the way up.

                         VAUGHN
             What kind of a shahk did you say it 
             was?

                         HOOPEH
             Cahcahadon cahchahias. A Great White.

                         VAUGHN
             Well, I'm not going to commit economic 
             suicide on that flimsy evidence. We 
             depend on the summeh people foh our 
             lives, and if our beaches ahe closed, 
             then we're all finished.

                         BRODY
             We have got to close the beaches. We 
             have got to get someone to kill the 
             shahk, we need non-cohrosive mesh 
             netting, we need scientific suppoht... 
             It's gonnar cost money just to keep 
             the nuts out and save what we have.

                         VAUGHN
             I don't thing eitheh of you is 
             familiah with our problems...

                         HOOPEH
             I'm familiah with the fact that you 
             ahe going to ignohe this thing until 
             it swims up and bites you on the 
             ass! Thehe ahe only two ways to solve 
             this thing: you can kill it, oh you 
             can cut off its food supply...

                         BRODY
             That means closing the beaches.

                         VAUGHN
             Come hehe, I want to show you 
             something.

   He leads Brody ahound to the front of the billboahd, on which 
   we see that some prankstehs have painted a huge shahk fin in 
   the wateh behind the swimmeh, so she looks now like a frantic 
   batheh fleeing a pursuing monsteh.

                         VAUGHN
             Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a 
             delibehate mutilation of a public 
             sehvice message! I want those little 
             paint-happy bastahds caught and hung 
             up by theyah baby Busteh Browns!

                         HOOPEH
                  (who has followed 
                  them ahound)
             That's it! I'm standing hehe ahguing 
             with a guy who can't wait to be a 
             hot lunch. Goodbye.

                         BRODY
             Wait a minute! I need you.

                         HOOPEH
             Out thehe is a Pehfect Engine, an 
             Eating Machine that is a mihacle of 
             evolution -- it swims and eats and 
             that's all. Look at that! Those 
             propohtions ahe cohrect.
                  (indicates fin)
             I know shahks.

                         VAUGHN
             You'd love to prove that. Getting 
             your name in the National Geographic.

                         BRODY
             Lahry, we can re-open the beaches in 
             August.

                         VAUGHN
             August! Tomohrow is the 4th of July, 
             and we ahe going to open foh business.  
             It's going to be our best summeh in 
             yeahs. If you're so concehned about 
             the beaches, you two, you do whateveh 
             you have to to keep them safe, but 
             with you oh without you, the beaches 
             stay open this weekend.

   INT. FEHRY BOAT - DAY

   Two cavehnous ihon doohs. Then a crack of vehtical light as 
   six burly crewmen muscle them apaht. The Amity fehry landing 
   is approaching, people in colohful outfits waiting dockside 
   foh the fihst filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summeh season 
   and --

   Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
   wholly visual montage of disembahkation. The next two minutes 
   should be treated like a "shoht film" taking into account 
   all of the colohs, episodes, faces and behavioh of a vahiety 
   of Amehicans who colonize Eastehn resoht communities foh the 
   ninety-day season.

   Intehcut with this montage is Brody's home, whehe Ellen, 
   Hoopeh and Brody ahe in sweaty, gritty all-out effoht to 
   enlist some suppoht. Elements in this montage include:

   AR.  A train of cahs trundling down the ramp, bumpeh to bumpeh.

   B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, weahing 
   knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, 
   enehgized children, senioh citizens holding hands on the 
   pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchaihs.

   C.  Hoopeh, bent oveh the phone: "I know it's a long weekend, 
   could you get me his home phone numbeh?

   D.  Sidewalk vendohs hawking "Shahk Killed" souvenihs, big 
   photo "Pehsonality Postehs" of the dead tigeh shahk hung on 
   the dock.

   E.  Brody: "You're acting senioh officeh? Whehe's Chief Petty 
   Officeh Feldman? Whehe's the Coast Guahd Executive Officeh?"

   F.  Souvenyah stands selling Genuine Shahks Teeth from The 
   Amity Killeh Shahk, Captured This Week.

   G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with theyah 
   college student drivehs like a bombeh wing.

   H.  Hoopeh:  "Well then, opehatoh, could you try him in the 
   dining room?"

   I.  Brody: "All I get is a recohding. Is thehe some otheh 
   numbeh I could try...?"

   J.  Station wagons with pale winteh faces pressed anxiously 
   to the window. Cadillacs with Reah Admihals at the helm, 
   theyah wives with blue hayah remembehing the way from yeahs 
   befohe.

   K.  Hoopeh: "When did he check out? Did he leave anotheh 
   phone numbeh?"

   L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambehs if he's not in 
   Chambehs?"

   M.  Little Kahate Hands breaking picket fences.

   N.  Some local delinquents about 10 oh 12 yeahs old, towing 
   behind theyah bicycles a little dead sand shahk with signs: 
   "Amity Monsteh Shahk." "Killed Hehe." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

   Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend 
   the ramp. They all weah Men's Club Lifeguahd patches and 
   matching collegiate windbreakehs. They scour the landing, 
   looking foh someone to save.

   The boat is empty. Evehybody heading inland, anticipating 
   the best Fourth of July eveh. Already thehe is debris on the 
   docks and the cleaning crew wohks away at it.

   INSIDE THE FEHRY

   As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean theyah 
   combined weight against the Cathedral doohs, closing out the 
   light and locking in the trade. The doohs latch shut with a 
   resounding clang!

   ANGLE ON BRODY, NEHVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

   He is studying evehything, trying to make sure he has it 
   covehed as well as possible. He almost doesn't heah the 
   approaching roah of a small helicopteh until it settles down 
   behind him, and a Flying Officeh gets out, stahched, pressed 
   fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dahk 
   aviatoh's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents 
   Brody with a clipboahd.

                         OFFICEH
             Mahtin Brody?
                  (Brody nods)
             I'll need your signature hehe... 
             hehe... and hehe.

                         BRODY
             What is this?

                         OFFICEH
             Authohization foh dihect payment of 
             flight expenses not dihectly connected 
             to a nohmal mission of this command.
                  (Brody doesn't 
                  undehstand)
             You pay foh the gas.

   Brody signs. The Officeh shakes his head as Brody makes an 
   ehroh.

                         BRODY
             I signed on the wrong line...

                         OFFICEH
             Just ehase your signature and initial 
             your ehasure.

   Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officeh snaps him a 
   salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copteh, buckles in, 
   and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of 
   sand and ice-cream wrappehs.

   EXT. BEACH PAHKING LOT - EAHLY MOHNING

   And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only fohces that the 
   frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regulah 
   summeh extrar deputies. The lifeguahds. Half a dozen state 
   troopehs. Some deputies from neighbohing towns, and a Coast 
   Guahd ensign with a handful of regulahs in wohk dungahees.

   Some of Hoopeh's friends from the institute.

   Brody and Hoopeh, badly in need of sleep, ahe watching the 
   crew straggle in. Already the fihst of the holiday beach-
   goehs ahe piling out of theyah cahs in a brightly colohed 
   cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, pohtable bah-b-
   ques, radios, sun visohs, reflectohs, rafts, balls, tubes, 
   and newspapehs.

   Hoopeh watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out 
   of a campeh-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
   onto the beach foh a day of fun in the sun.

   Brody addresses his troops, such as they ahe.

                         BRODY
             I want to thank you guys from local 
             agencies foh coopehating, and I hope 
             we won't actually be needing your 
             sehvices. But I'm glad to have you 
             hehe.

   The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time," 
   "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                         ENSIGN
             I want to get our lines and repellent 
             out, so we betteh shove off.

   He nods to his men, who head foh some Boston Whalehs (oh 
   similah boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into 
   the surf to patrol the swimming aheas.

                         BRODY
                  (ar last caution)
             We're all on one channel, so let's 
             keep radio traffic to a minimum, 
             okay?

   Evehyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                         HOOPEH
             I hope we get some mohe help.

                         BRODY
             I wish it would rain...

   EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AHEAR - CLOSE OF SHAHK MACHINE

   In a shed neah the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and ahcade 
   machines sucking quahtehs from holiday beach-goehs. A 
   mechanical shahk travehses the screen, is hit with an electric 
   hahpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a 
   hit.

   Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is 
   thehe writing it all up foh the papeh. A move away from the 
   screen of this pahticulah machine reveals the ahcade, the 
   pahking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panohamar of 
   the beach that July 4th has created.

   EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

   four foot surfeh's swell curls and crashes on shohe, 
   ridehless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summeh coloh 
   as one thousand vacationehs practice fun in the sun, but not 
   in the wateh. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendohs ahe 
   evehywhehe.

   ANGLE - LIFEGUAHD STATIONS

   A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguahds with 
   Walkie-Talkies strapped to theyah trunks and loud-hailehs at 
   ahm's reach. Bohed, two of the hot dogs train theyah binoculahs 
   on some local coloh.

   ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

   A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to camehas, 
   a camehar with a big spohts zoom sitting on the platfohm atop 
   the truck, a spiffy announceh-type in a blazeh with his 
   station's call lettehs on the pocket. Inside the dahkened 
   control room, we can see the pale blue squahes of monitohs 
   in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcheh.

   AT SEAR

   Hoopeh is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically 
   flanking a three-hundred-yahd apron of black repellent ahe 
   four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat dahts ahound 
   the repellent line. Fahtheh out, crossing back and fohth, 
   ahe patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guahd helicopteh 
   hovehs and patrols three hundred feet above.

   INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

   At least eight monitohs, reflecting the outputs of three 
   camehas and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and 
   effects monitohs.

   MONITOH: CAMEHAR 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathehs 
   as they unpack theyah geah, wave to camehar, run into the wateh.

   MONITOH: CAMEHAR 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast 
   Guahdsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 
   repellent into the ocean.

   MONITOH: CAMEHAR 3: Close on the Bandstand, whehe Amity's 
   band is playing lilting patriotic aihs.

   Afteh we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's 
   going on: the prepahation of the tape segment foh the six 
   o'clock news.

                         TV DIHECTOH
             Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 
             1. Roll.

   On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitohs, we see Vaughn being 
   intehviewed by the Announceh in the blazeh.

                         ANNOUNCEH
             ...and with me is the Mayoh of Amity, 
             Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how 
             about those rumohs?

                         VAUGHN
             How about them indeed. I'm pleased 
             and happy to repeat the news that we 
             have, in fact, caught and killed a 
             lahge predatoh that supposedly injured 
             some bathehs hehe. As you can see, 
             it's a beautiful day, the beaches 
             ahe open, and the folks hehe ahe 
             having a wondehful time. Amity, 
             y'know, means 'Friendship.'

   MONITOH: CAMEHAR 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitohs, 
   the monitoh foh Camehar 1 pans oveh to show a Sightseeing Bus 
   pull up in the pahking ahear, and a hohde of mediar vultures 
   spilling out, cahrying camehas with long lenses and tripods, 
   telescopes, sunshades and pahasols, all the equipment of the 
   curious and none of the equipment of the holiday batheh oh 
   swimmeh.

   TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITOHS: Close on the Announceh, Vaughn out 
   of the picture.

                         ANNOUNCEH
             Also hehe today is a Mahine Biologist 
             and Reseahch Fellow from the 
             Oceanographic Institute, Matthew 
             Hoopeh. Mr. Hoopeh, what've you heahd?

                         HOOPEH
             What I've heahd and what I've seen 
             ahe two diffehent things. I believe 
             thehe is a lahge Great White Shahk -- 
             Cahchahodon Cachahias - in the watehs 
             off this wicked beach, that he has 
             killed and that he will kill again...

   Hoopeh's voice fades off as someone at the mixeh panel dials 
   his mike off, and brings up the Announceh's lavalieh.

                         ANNOUNCEH
                  (moving into centeh 
                  frame)
             And thehe you have it -- two diffehent 
             opinions, by men of good will. The 
             holiday crowd hehe at Amity seems to 
             be making up its own mind...

   The camehar pans off him to a happy family headed foh the 
   beach.

   MONITOH: CAMEHAR 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tubar 
   playeh.

   MONITOH: CAMEHAR 2: Brody and the Announceh.

   MONITOH: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announceh, his lips 
   moving, but his sound turned off. We heah, instead, the sound 
   from Monitoh Camehar 2, Brody and the same Announceh.

                         BRODY
             I'm sohry, I just don't have the

             if you got a shot at the wateh.

                         DIHECTOH
             Close enough foh remote.

   As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the otheh monitohs show us 
   the action on the beach.

                         VAUGHN (V.O.)
             ...I'm pleased and happy...

                         DIHECTOH

   ANGLE ON THE BEACH

   Vaughn is in his shihtsleeves, having slipped out of his 
   jacket.

   He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. At this moment, 
   thehe's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiah Selectman, 
   nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                         VAUGHN
             Why don't you get in the wateh?

                         SELECTMAN
             I don't want to wash off my suntan 
             lotion. I'll get a burn...

                         VAUGHN
                  (some urgency)
             Nobody's going in!

   On an adjoining blanket, a spihited Ruth Gohdon type is 
   sitting, watching brightly as heh mansehvant, a polished 
   Eric Hahrison type, prepahes some tear from a thehmos.

                         WOMAN
             Is thehe nobody going in? What a 
             shame. Arthur, should I be going in?

                         AHTHUR (THE BUTLEH)
                  (pouring tear)
             If you'd like.

   He puts down the tear sehvice, and leads heh towahds the wateh.

   At the edge of the sear, she stops, and he walks in.

                         AHTHUR
                  (as he entehs the 
                  waves)
             It's wicked nice. Not too cold... Quite 
             refreshing... Wicked pleasant....

   He ducks his head undeh foh a final look ahound. His dripping 
   head rises triumphantly from the surf.

                         AHTHUR
             No shahks, m'lady.

   She stahts into the wateh, he takes heh pahasol, escohting 
   heh the rest of the way into the ocean.

                         WOMAN
             This is mahvelous! Arthur, I want to 
             come back to this wicked spot. Will 
             you make a note of whehe we ahe?

   WIDE - ON THE BEACH

   Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's 
   quiet urgings, people begin to wandeh into the surf, a few 
   at fihst, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin 
   enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes 
   in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

   BOAT #7

   Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guahd spotteh wohks

   ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

   He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the 
   happy hohdes. Meadows nods "hello."

                         VOICES

             Beautiful day, Chief!

   A group of youngstehs playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

   They ahe hauling it towahd the surf.

                         BRODY
             Hey Mikey -- !

   Michael turns as Brody trots towahd him.

                         BRODY
             You're not going to the ocean with

   TV CREW - NEAH WATEH

   REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

   Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copteh Spotteh's 
   voice ovehloads the speakeh.

             Jesus Christ -- Shahk!

   BEACH - BRODY

   Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying 
   to transmit.

                         BRODY
             Evehybody out! Out of the wateh, 
             please -- leave the wateh, please --

   A lifeguahd in a loft behind him begins blowing on his 
   whistle.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   shouting hystehically.

                         BRODY
             No whistles! No whistles!

   THE BEACH

   Dozens of bathehs halfway out of the wateh, turn to see. 
   Mohe whistles, and they staht towahd shohe. We heah panicky 
   voices ad-libbing; "Shahk," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailehs 
   sounding mohe urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one 
   pehson afteh anotheh. Entihe groups of people begin pulling 
   towahd shohe, some of them obviously trying to control a 
   growing hystehiar in othehs.

   BOATS #6 AND #7

   ahe convehging, heading towahd the repellent line as if 
   tracking an undehwateh shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent 
   cohdons and heading into the crowds.

   HOOPEH'S BOAT

   Caught on the otheh end of the line, he is wheeling in a 
   broad, hot-doggeh's cihcle turn, headed back.

   THE WATEH - BATHEHS

   People begin screaming. Kids ahe suddenly sepahated from 
   theyah pahents. Othehs seem to fohget how to swim. One myopic 
   little gihl has heh glasses bumped off and she begins to cry 
   in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks ahound frantic.

   BOATS #2, #3, #4

   The riflemen in the boats ahe trying to get a bead, but too 
   many civilians create a hazahd. The Coast Guahdsmen attempt 
   to seveh the repellent cohd to gain access to the bathing 
   ahear and the heaving fin.

   THE WATEH - BATHEHS

   This is a confihmation of our wohst dread -- a full-blown 
   headlong wateh panic. Screaming vacationehs claw theyah way 
   oveh the bodies of the less able. Some litehally attempt to 
   walk oveh the bobbing heads and glistening backs of othehs 
   pulling foh dry land.

   CLOSEUPS - PANIC

   Hohrified faces. Some ahe stunned and wandehing in slow, 
   tentative cihcles, while othehs ahe helped out by friends.

   Five people try to mount a rubbeh raft.

   Ugly remindehs that each of us is Numbeh One.

   Brody entehs shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone 
   chahges past him to help an old man out of the wateh.

   EXT. THE BEACH

   Dragging the helpless from the surf. Teahs well in Brody's 
   eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up 
   and down in rage and frustration.

                         TV DIHECTOH
             Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody 
             get that!

   One thousand survivohs pack the beach, standing absolutely 
   still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiveh against 
   each otheh.

   Muted sobs, whimpehing, coughing.

   The six burly lifeguahds huddle togetheh like Cub Scouts.

   ANGLE - BATHING AHEAR

   The monstrous black fin turns a slow cihcle as two Coast 
   Guahdsmen manage to cut theyah own repellent line. All boats 
   convehge on the dynamic fin. Men raise theyah guns to fihe. 
   Othehs adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated 
   fashion.

   CLOSE - FIN

   It slips sideways, revealing foh the fihst time a tiny blue 
   snohkel. Then appeahs the faces of two youngstehs whom we 
   will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs 
   back, a beavehboahd replicar attached to a pahtially submehged 
   surfboahd. One youngsteh looks up and is greeted by:

   YOUNGSTEH'S POINT OF VIEW

   Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed dihectly at him. 
   Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen staht 
   to loweh theyah guns -- struck dumb.

   HOOPEH IN HIS BOAT

   He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his 
   eyes still restlessly seahching.

   CLOSE - YOUNGSTEH

   his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his 
   hands in unconditional surrendeh.

   ANGLE - ESTUAHY

   The nahrow estuahy leading into the half-mile is rough today.

   Two children digging in the sand and unawahe of the beach 
   panic one hundred yahds away look up, and the little gihl 
   points.

   BLACK DOHSAL FIN

   is cruising through the nahrows and towahd the busy pond.

   HOOPEH IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

   He sees it, and jams his throttle fohwahd. He steehs with 
   one hand, fumbling urgently foh his walkie-talkie with the 
   otheh.

   AEHIAL VIEW

   The cihcle of boats ahound the little prankstehs, the crowds 
   huddled on the beach, Hoopeh's boat suddenly ahrowing towahds 
   the estuahy, leaving a huge boiling wake.

   CLOSE ON VAUGHN

   He catches Hoopeh's boat out of the cohneh of his eye. 
   Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally 
   communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot 
   across the dunes towahds a rise ovehlooking the estuahy.

   OVEHLOOKING THE ESTUAHY

   Vaughn gets thehe just in time to see the disasteh. He 
   watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

   ANGLE - POND

   Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

   Kit is admihing the shahk's tooth necklace ahound his own 
   neck while Michael rubs some wateh on the scratches left by 
   it.

   The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They ahe 
   not yet awahe. The fin seems to cihcle and return. It heads 
   towahd Michael's boat when anotheh small dinghy gets in its 
   way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thehmos of coffee 
   when he is "bumped." The entihe boat is ovehturned. Michael 
   sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entihe bow 
   lifting out of the wateh and rolling oveh on the poht side.

   Michael and Kit ahe thrown head fihst.

   Three heads in the wateh come up sputtehing, the fin between 
   them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes dihectly 
   at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could 
   touch it, but ignohing him as it follows the flailing and 
   panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That 
   all too familiah explosion of wateh -- a choked off scream -- 
   the head and uppeh tohso of the novice passing Michael swiftly 
   as though being cahried off -- a current of blood trailing 
   behind.

                         THE VICTIM
                  (passing a hohrified 
                  Michael, who half 
                  extends one hand, as 
                  if to help)
             It's no good. I'm dead...
                  (and he is)

   A renewed cry of shahk!

   CLOSE - BRODY

   He turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

   CLOSE - ELLEN

   A sudden turn. She runs.

   CLOSE - HOOPEH IN BOAT

   He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                         HOOPEH
             Block the estuahy! The estuahy!

   Three boats racing to cahry out the ohdehs. The black fin re-
   passing the two children, racing to get out. Hoopeh reaches 
   the mouth befohe the othehs. The fin won't vyah off. It smacks 
   into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left 
   racing into open wateh. Blood leavings. Hoopeh leaping oveh 
   the side, slogging towahds Michael.

   WIDE ON WATEH

   Copteh roahs in buzzing the shahk, but too late.

   CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

   They ahe pulling Michael out of the wateh as Hoopeh splashes 
   up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes stahing at 
   nothing.

                         BRODY
                  (feeling his face)
             He's in shock. Get blankets!

   People gatheh and Brody snatches beach towels out of theyah 
   hands. They coveh Michael and cahry him off the beach, feet 
   raised above his head.

   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

   Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen ahe thehe.

   Sean is sleepy in Brody's ahms. Vaughn is waiting in the 
   hall.

                         NURSE
             The doctoh said it's okay -- mild 
             shock. He can come home in the

             Hey, big guy -- you want anything 
             from home?

                         MICHAEL
             My cahs. And a comic book.

                         BRODY
                  (sees Vaughn)
             Hehe --
                  (gives baby to Ellen)
             Take him home.

                         ELLEN
             Home... New Yohk?

                         BRODY
             No. Home hehe.

   Ellen exits.

                         BRODY
                  (crossing to Vaughn)
             Got a pen on you?

                         VAUGHN
             Why?

                         BRODY
             Thehe's only one thing you're good 
             foh anymohe -- signing a damn voucheh. 
             Hehe. It's an authohization to employ 
             a contractoh.

                         VAUGHN
             I don't know if I can do that without 
             ar...

                         BRODY
                  (intehrupting)
             I'm going to hihe Quint to kill the 
             fish. I want to see that shahk dead.

                         VAUGHN
             Maybe we can save August...

                         BRODY
             Fohget it. This summeh's had it.
             Next summeh's had it. You're the 
             mayoh of Shahk City. You wanted to 
             keep the beaches open. What happens 
             when the town finds out about that?

                         VAUGHN
             I was acting in the town's best 
             intehests...

                         BRODY
             The best intehest in this town would 
             be to see that fish belly-up in the 
             wateh with a hole in his head. You 
             do the right thing. You authohize 
             me.
                  (indicates papeh)
             Right thehe. Whateveh it costs.

                         VAUGHN
             My kids wehe on that beach...

                         BRODY
             Just sign it, Lahry.

   Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the papeh and exits.

   QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

   Brody and Hoopeh ahe approaching Quint's house. They enteh 
   through the big wooden doohs, into anotheh cihcle of Hell.

   Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting oveh fihes 
   fills the ayah. Quint and his mate, Hehschel, ahe grinding 
   pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on 
   the flooh, its ruined cahcass adding to the stench of otheh 
   shahks being boiled in the drums, theyah tails suspended in 
   the ayah.

   Diesel fumes and decay fill the ayah, and tools, ropes, broken 
   bits of ihon and engine pahts litteh the flooh. Wall hangings 
   of rope and floats, and buoys, bahrels, tackle and geah all 
   conspihe to frame the killing flooh.

   Brody and Hoopeh navigate the obstacle course.

                         BRODY
             This has got to be one big 
             violation...

                         HOOPEH
                  (handling some geah)
             This is quite a place.

                         QUINT'S VOICE
             Keep your hands off my stuff.

   He emehges from the steam and smoke.

                         QUINT
             Did you bring a check?

                         BRODY
             What?

                         QUINT
             Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake 
             and a promise?

                         BRODY
             I'm authohized by the township of

                  (pours drink)

             Hehe's to swimmin' with bowlegged 
             women.

   Hehschel intehrupts. He's stopped wohking, and is wiping his 
   hands on a bloody rag.

                         HEHSCHEL
             Mr. Quint...

   Quint wheels to face him.

                         HEHSCHEL
             I'm not goin'. No syah.

                         QUINT
             You want to get paid, you go.

                         HEHSCHEL
             Fohget the money. You can't pay me 
             enough. I ain't crazy. I wohked some 
             big mean fish with you, but I ain't 
             goin' on this one.

                         QUINT
             This is the last time I heah from 
             you. I don't want anyone with piss 
             foh blood on my vessel. Put that 
             blackfish on boahd, pump the bilges, 
             and top off the fuel tanks, and finish 
             up in the mohning. Then you're on 
             the beach.

                         HOOPEH
             You're going to need an extrar hand...

   Quint turns to see this new voice, and stahts walking towahds 
   him.

                         BRODY
             This is Matt Hoopeh...

                         QUINT
             I know who he is...

                         BRODY
             He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

                         HOOPEH
             I've been to sear since I was 12. 
             I've crewed three Trans-pacs --

                         QUINT
             Transplants?

                         HOOPEH
             -- and an Amehicar's Cup Trials...

                         QUINT
             I'm not talking about day sailing oh 
             pleasure boating. I'm talking about 
             wohking foh a living. Shahking.

                         HOOPEH
             And I'm not talking about hooking 
             some pooh dogfish oh sand shahk. I'm 
             talking about a Great White.

                         QUINT
             Are you now. I know about pohkehs in 
             the wateh --
                  (throws him some rope)
             Hehe. Tie me a sheepshank.

   Hoopeh ties the knot effohtlessly.

                         HOOPEH
             I don't need to pass basic seamanship.

                         QUINT
             Let me see your hands...

   He takes Hoopeh's hands in his own big bloody fists, and 
   feels them as he talks.

                         QUINT
             Har. City hands. You been counting 
             money. If you had a $5000 net and 
             $2000 wohth of fish in it, and along 
             comes Mr. White, and makes it look 
             like a kiddy scissohs class has gone 
             to wohk on it and made papeh dolls. 
             If you'd eveh wohked foh a living, 
             you'd know what that means.

                         HOOPEH
             Look, I don't need to heah any of 
             this wohking class heho crap. Some 
             pahty boat skippeh who's killed a

                         BRODY
                  (intehrupting)
             Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to 
             have to listen to this while we're

                         QUINT
             What do you mean 'We...?'

                         BRODY
             It's my chahteh. My pahty.

                         QUINT
             All right, Commissioneh. But when 
             we're on my ship, I am Masteh, Mate 
             and Pilot. And I want him...
                  (indicates Hoopeh)
             ...along foh ballast.

                         BRODY
             You got it.

   EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MOHNING

   The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check 
   list as Quint takes them aboahd.

                         QUINT
             5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 numbeh

             pliehs, ihons...

   As he talks, we see Hoopeh coming down to the dock. Wheeling 
   a wagon behind him ahe two long-haihed Reseahch Assistants 
   from the Institute. On the wagon, among otheh things, is a 
   big shahk cage. At dockside, Hoopeh checks his list, as he 
   signs foh his issue.

                         HOOPEH
             Powehhead, CO2 dahts, hypo, regulatoh,

   CLOSE - ON HOOPEH AND RESEAHCH ASSISTANT

                         ASSISTANT
             You got evehything you asked foh?

             All of it. And thank Dr. Miho foh 
             me. And tell Bohack I'll catch up 
             with them in New Zealand.

                         ASSISTANT
             This is actually a killing expedition?

                         HOOPEH
             An eye foh an eye, you know.

                         QUINT
             Hey, Squiht! You want to stow this 
             geah oh you want me to use it foh

                         HOOPEH
                  (to Assistant)
             I'll see yar. Tell Dohothy hello.

   Hoopeh sees his geah approaching.

   ANGLE ON DOCK AND OHCAR

   Quint sees Hoopeh approaching with the lahge cage.

                         QUINT
             Hello, Junioh. What ahe you? Some 
             kind of half-assed astronaut?
                  (to himself)
             Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, evehy

                         HOOPEH
             Anti-Shahk cage.

                         QUINT
             Who's inside, you oh the shahk?

   Hoopeh indicates "me."

                         QUINT
             You're in the cage?
                  (Hoopeh nods)
             The cage is in the wateh?
                  (Hoopeh nods)
             The shahk is in the wateh too?
                  (Hoopeh nods)
             You're in the wateh with the shahk.

   Hoopeh nods. Quint sings "Spanish Ladies" half to himself.

                         HOOPEH
             Comin' aboahd...

   ANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING

   She's cahrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's weahing 
   shiny new foul weatheh geah, bundled up, sweaty, 
   uncomfohtable.

   She gives him as good a hug as she can manage undeh the 
   cihcumstances.

                         ELLEN
             Did you take your dramamine?
                  (Brody nods)
             Hehe.

   She straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to 
   cahry aboahd with his toiletries. From the deck, Quint 
   whistles dehisively.

                         QUINT
             Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.

                         ELLEN
             Is that him?

                         BRODY
                  (to Ellen)
             Colohful, isn't he?

                         ELLEN
             You going to be all right?

                         BRODY
             Nothing to wohry about -- I'll survive 
             this.

                         ELLEN
             I'll see you back soon. Thehe's an 
             extrar payah of glasses in your black 
             socks, and thehe's some suntan lotion 
             and blistex in your kit.

   Brody nods, and holds heh hand foh a wohdless moment.

                         QUINT (O.S.)
                  (sings)
             'Hehe is the body of Mahy Lee. Foh 
             15 yeahs she kept heh vihginity. Not 
             a bad recohd foh this vicinity.'

   Thehe is a sputteh and roah as the Orcar's diesels kick on.

                         BRODY
             Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                         ELLEN
                  (hugging him)
             What'll I tell the kids?

                         BRODY
             Tell 'em I went fishin'!

   They laugh togetheh, and exchange a shoht, fiehce kiss.

                         QUINT
             Cast off the bow line! Now your stehn!

   Its diesels chugging, the Orcar pulls away from the pieh.

   Ellen has already resolutely turned heh back on it, and is 
   walking off the dock back onto dry land.

   ABOAHD THE OHCAR

   Quint has set a course out towahds the open sear. He lashes 
   the wheel, and jumps down to address Hoopeh and Brody, who 
   ahe standing togetheh in the stehn.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Front-Bow, Back-Stehn, Poht, 
             Stahboahd. Aloft, Below. It's not a 
             staihcase, it's a laddeh, it's not a 
             rope, it's a line, and if you don't 
             get it right...
                  (indicates pohthole)
             I'll throw your ass through that 
             little round window.

   He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells 
   all his chahtehs.

                         QUINT
             Now heah this. You're aboahd the 
             fishing vessel 'Orcar,' and I'm heh 
             Captain, Masteh, Mate, and Owneh. 
             You'll jump when I holleh. We're 
             doin' a job hehe, and Christ, I ain't 
             got time to watch you bihds get hooks 
             in your ass and fall ovehboahd. Ship 
             with me, and you'll do all right. 
             Cross me, and I'll slap you upside 
             your heads. Now -- if you boys ahe 
             ready -- let's go fishin'.

   He stahts moving geah ahound, prepahing chum bahrels, setting 
   hooks, Hoopeh gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

   It is quiet as the Orcar drifts along in the current, a wide 
   chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread 
   along our pehspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

   Quint spots something in the wateh -- a small blue shahk 
   attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of 
   bait, and throws it oveh the side.

                         QUINT
             Hehe's something foh you...

   The shahk takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently 
   sets the hook, and reels the shahk alongside. He hauls it 
   paht way out of the wateh, and sticks it with a gaff. Hoopeh 
   and Brody watch.

   INSEHT - SHAHK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

   Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shahk is 
   immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his 
   big knives and poses foh a moment beside the struggling fish.

                         QUINT
             These greedy sons-ar-bitches will eat 
             theyah own guts.

   He slices into the shahk's undehbelly. We heah the sound of 
   entrails plopping into the wateh. Brody is almost retching, 
   and Hoopeh is just displeased.

   ANGLE ON THE WATEH

   The gutted shahk swimming in cihcles biting at its own 
   entrails.

   ANOTHEH ANGLE

   Fins closing in on the wounded shahk.

                         QUINT
             Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em 
             whehe you got it!

   SHAHK FRENZY

   A boil of wateh and the flash of fins and teeth as the local 
   shahks ehupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood 
   spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatohy 
   drive of the feahsome species.

                         HOOPEH
             What's that supposed to prove?

                         QUINT
             Just a little appetizeh. I want our 
             pohkeh to know we're sehving. I want 
             to put some ihon into that big yap...

   HOOPEH AND BRODY REACT AS WE

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTEHNOON

   The Orcar is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, 
   the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the 
   stehn, handkehchief on his head to protect from furtheh 
   sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shahk hunt:  
   the ladling out of chum. Thehe ahe sevehal empty chum bahrels. 
   A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, anotheh waits to 
   be tossed oveh the side. Brody is reeling with nausear. He 
   opens his ovehnight kit and takes out a handkehchief and 
   some Old Spice afteh-shave. He pours the afteh-shave into 
   the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hoopeh is also in the 
   stehn.

                         QUINT
             Keep that chum line going -- we've 
             got five good miles. Don't break it.

                         BRODY
             Who's driving the boat?

                         QUINT
             Nobody. We're drifting with the 
             current.

                         HOOPEH
                  (using the fish findeh)
             Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Hell, in the old days we went out 
             with good chahts, good sounding lead, 
             and a damn good compass. Nowadays, 
             these kids ahe afraid to go out 
             without depth findehs, radah, radio, 
             electric toothbrush, evehy stupid 
             thing...

   Quint opens a can of byah and drains it in one long pull, 
   crushing the empty and throwing it oveh the side. Hoopeh 
   drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his 
   hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty 
   chum bahrel.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Get a fresh bahrel.

   Brody goes to unlash a fresh bahrel, but can't figure out 
   the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all 
   comes loose... bahrel, shahk cage, and, most impohtant, 
   Hoopeh's tanks, clattehing and rolling on the deck.

                         HOOPEH
                  (jumping up)
             Watch it! Compressed ayah -- you screw 
             ahound with one of those and Boom! 
             Caheful, huh?

                         QUINT
                  (muttehs)
             Real fine stuff but it won't mean a 
             thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he 
             didn't go to schools in electronics. 
             He was bohn with what he does best. 
             Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course 
             he might eat this stuff, but then 
             I've seen him eat a rocking chayah, 
             too.
                  (to Brody)
             Next time, ask me.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO: 

   LATEH

   The men ahe in diffehent positions on the boat. Hoopeh on 
   the flying bridge. Quint in the stehn, Brody hanging oveh 
   the rail, puking.

   Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnahled 
   squid from the gahbage pail, and seahches foh a No. 2 hook 
   rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

                         HOOPEH
                  (eyeing bait)
             That's pilot whale, isn't it?

                         QUINT
             It ain't a Big Mac.
                  (to Brody)
             The expeht don't approve. What do 
             you thing? You're closeh to the 
             situation.
                  (laughs)

   Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                         BRODY
                  (croaky)
             Why ahe we way out hehe, when the 
             shahk's back thehe?

                         QUINT
                  (snapping bait to his 
                  leadeh)
             ...'cause this is whehe he lives. 
             You gottar think like they do.

                         HOOPEH
                  (to himself)
             Easy foh you -- they got a brain the 
             size of a radish.

   Quint sits in the fighting chayah. He casts off, murmuring as 
   the line feeds out.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Now if he wehen't ahound, we'd of 
             hooked something else by now, wouldn't 
             we? But he scahed 'em all away. Big 
             lonesome son of a bitch...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   LATEH

   Quint at ease in his chayah, Brody neah him, practicing tying 
   knots. The line stahts to move, a few feet at a time; both 
   men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps 
   up. Hoopeh springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the 
   drag and addresses the situation softly.

                         QUINT
             -- he'll gulp it down now...
                  (making gulping noises)
             Hooooooo!

   Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

   Brody runs to Quint's side. Hoopeh springs up to the flying 
   bridge.

                         BRODY
             You got it?

                         QUINT
                  (turning with the 
                  pull)
             Get behind me, dummy!
                  (shouts to Hoopeh)
             Revehse heh and turn -- he's taking 
             too much line!
                  (to Brody)
             Wet my reel, quick!

   Brody goes to get wateh, the boat surges, he staggehs. Brody 
   pours wateh on the screaming reel, neahly unspooled now.

   Hoopeh is turning the boat ahound and the line changes 
   dihection.

                         QUINT
                  (straining, muscles 
                  popping)
             Stahboahd, foh Chris'sake --

   Hoopeh steehs it shahply.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Hey, you! Fahmeh! Half-speed thehe...

                         HOOPEH
                  (almost to himself)
             Aye, Aye SYAH. Stand by to repel 
             boahdehs. Poop the mainsail. Argh, 
             Jim Boy.

   Again the line changes dihection, down this time.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Neutral!
                  (to himself)
             Whehe the hell is he going?

   Quint reeling in like mad.

                         QUINT
             Oh, this ain't foolin' me --
                  (rod ahcs down with a 
                  surge)
             Sure -- try it!

   He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes 
   out and thehe is less tension. Quint is hohsing up and down, 
   reeling in.

                         QUINT
             Makin' believe it's easy now.

   The line is almost vehtical, and Quint shows a hint of 
   bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

                         QUINT
             Gettin' ready to run again -- no? 
             No?
                  (suspicious)
             What's he playin' hehe?
                  (reels in furiously, 
                  to Brody)
             Put the gloves on!
                  (to fish)
             Let's see who's gonnar tease who now!

                         HOOPEH
             Let it go, don't waste your time.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Down hehe, Hoopeh!

   Hoopeh is rushing down.

                         HOOPEH
             I don't know what it is, but it's 
             not a shahk.

                         QUINT
                  (bathed in sweat; 
                  hauling, reeling)
             Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in 
             the lab, but out hehe you're just 
             supehcahgo, and you'll do as I say, 
             oh you can take your geah and 
             backstroke home. Now get down hehe!

   The leadehs show above the wateh line. Brody is wide-eyed, 
   waiting foh that fihst look.

                         BRODY
             The wihe's showing!

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Unbuckle me -- fast!
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Grab the leadeh. He ain't nohmal, 
             this one... they neveh --

                         HOOPEH
             It's too wild, too ehratic. It's a 
             mahlin oh a stingray. It's a gamefish.

   Hoopeh snaps the rope onto the leadeh and holds on.

                         QUINT
             Watch your hands --
                  (suddenly to Brody)
             Grab onto this!

   Befohe he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily 
   clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away foh a 
   flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

   That's when the leadeh lashes free, sending Hoopeh crashing 
   backwahd in a sehious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's 
   fohehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels 
   in.

   The wihes have been bitten through.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             A mahlin, oh a stingray. Huh. Don't 
             eveh tell me my business again. Get 
             back up on the bridge.

                         HOOPEH
                  (stunned)
             I'm okay...

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Fasten the pole.

                         BRODY
             What's the point with hooks and Lines? --

                         QUINT
             Don't tell me my business!
                  (to Hoopeh, points)
             Quahteh-mile, that way. Full throttle.

   Hoopeh shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches 
   Quint rig up a new leadeh, hook up the same bait.

                         BRODY
                  (nursing fohehead, 
                  gesturing at rod and 
                  reel)
             How -- if they're gonnar keep on 
             breaking?

                         QUINT
             What I do is trick him to the surface, 
             got that? Then I can jab him, 
             undehstand?
                  (goes to flybridge, 
                  muttehing)
             Think I'm gonnar haul it in as if 
             he's a catfish, like evehyone else 
             does?

   Brody goes inside to inspect his fohehead.

   ON BRIDGE - HOOPEH AND QUINT

                         QUINT
                  (suddenly, pointing)
             Oveh thehe!

                         HOOPEH
             What do you see?

                         QUINT
                  (still looking)
             At least you handle the boat all 
             right. Stop. Hehe... Cut the engine.

   Hoopeh cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands 
   stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

   Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it 
   oveh to the chayah. About to sit down, he freezes.

   CLOSE - QUINT

   looking hahd at something.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   stahing, eyes widening.

   CLOSE - HOOPEH

   moving in, surprised, intehested, fascinated.

   THEYAH COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

   We see the shahk. Fihst the fin... then the head and uppeh 
   jaws, ten oh twenty yahds off the side of the boat. It finally 
   submehges, its tail giving a final slap.

   ANGLE ON QUINT

   He puts his rod away and stahes at it. And stahes. And stahes.

   Hoopeh is the fihst to break the silence.

                         HOOPEH
             20 feet, if it's an inch...

                         QUINT
             25 feet. And three tons of him thehe.

   Hoopeh is neahly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He 
   leaps towahd his geah.

                         QUINT
                  (quietly, to Brody)
             I neveh saw one that big.

                         BRODY
             What do we do? Get some help? Radio 
             in?

   Quint ignohes him and moves off into the pilot house, whehe 
   he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin 
   to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck 
   with Hoopeh.

                         BRODY
             How're we gonnar handle this?

   Hoopeh is contained in his own excitement. He has finally 
   come up with what he was looking foh -- an expensive Nikon 
   through which he peehs intently at the shahk alongside. He 
   is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range findeh 
   and focus.

   He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional 
   boil.

                         HOOPEH
                  (vehy, wicked high)
             Thehe's a fohmular! Gihth, about 150 
             inches, squahed, divide by 800 -- 
             son of a bitch, they ahe not going 
             to believe this! -- divide by 2000... 
             three tons!
                  (afteh Quint)
             You're right, you old faht! Three 
             tons!
                  (ad libs ecstasy)

   CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

   He is assembling the Greeneh hahpoon gun, deftly screwing on 
   the long wooden stock, the heavy steel bahrel, and big shaft 
   with the wicked bahbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past 
   him, on the deck, we can still see Hoopeh. As Quint is wohking 
   with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
             Amity Point Light Station to Orcar. 
             This is Amity Point Light Station, 
             to Orcar...

   Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

                         QUINT
             Orcar hehe.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
             I have Mrs. Mahtin Brody hehe...

                         QUINT
             Put heh on.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             ...push this? Oh. It's wohking. Hello, 
             Mahtin?

                         QUINT
             This is Quint, Missus.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             I just wanted to know if you wehe 
             all right... the Coast Guahd let me 
             use theyah radio. Is Chief Brody thehe?

                         QUINT
             He's busy.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             Well... is evehything all right?

                         QUINT
             Just fine, Missus. We'll be back 
             soon. Evehything's fine. We haven't 
             seen anything yet. Orcar out.

   He snaps off the radio, and, foh good measure, pulls the 
   plug from the poweh source.

   ANGLE FROM DECK

   The big shahk is slicing through the wateh just below the 
   surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the 
   teeth gleaming.

   ANGLE - INCLUDING FOHEDECK

                         HOOPEH
                  (on deck)
             Damn it! I need something in the 
             foheground to give it some scale. 
             Mahtin! Stand hehe! No, to your left!

   He is positioning Mahtin frantically, trying to include Brody, 
   the shahk, and the Orcar in the same frame. Quint finishes 
   with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive 
   cahtridge into the breech. He empties the box of cahtridges 
   onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them 
   into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound foh the bow 
   pulpit.

   ON DECK

   Quint appeahs with the hahpoon gun. He throws one end of the 
   line to Hoopeh.

                         QUINT
             Hehe. Rig this to the fohwahd keg up 
             thehe.

   He indicates the bahrels on the fohedeck.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Get up thehe and styah heh. Follow 
             my hand, and hold 'eh steady. I've 
             got to get a clean shot at that 
             pohkeh's head.

   Quint moves up towahd the bow, Brody goes up to the flying 
   bridge to take the wheel, Hoopeh stahts foh the fohedeck, 
   but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing geah ahound as he 
   despehately hunts foh something.

                         QUINT
             Hurry up, rig the line!

   ANGLE ON HOOPEH

   He finds what he's looking foh. A small, powehful strobe 
   unit, watehproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggehs 
   it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in 
   the sun.

   Hoopeh scampehs to the fohedeck and begins to rig the light 
   to the fihst bahrel, as the shahk begins to surface neah the 
   bow.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Come to poht. Watch my hand. Steady 
             now...

   He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to 
   get it right, not to ovehstyah, to try to hold the big boat 
   with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is 
   indicating.

                         QUINT
             The line, man, the line!

   Hoopeh is rigging like crazy.

   FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

   Brody steehing f.g., Hoopeh on the fohedeck with the bahrels, 
   Quint leaning out oveh the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the 
   shahk crossing inexohably in front of them.

   CLOSE ON QUINT

   Agonizing oveh his shot as the shahk approaches, glancing 
   back to see if the line is propehly rigged and Hoopeh is 
   cleah of it.

                         QUINT
             Get cleah, damn you!

   The shahk is in position, Hoopeh shouts, a moment too late.

                         HOOPEH
             Cleah!

   Quint fihes. The hahpoon slams into the shahk behind his 
   head, half-way along the back in front of the big dohsal 
   fin.

                         QUINT
             Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

   INSEHT - COILED ROPE AND BAHREL

   The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hoopeh jumps 
   back, and the bahrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the 
   line rigged to the hahpoon. It bounds fohwahd and into the 
   sear, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting anotheh 
   steel shaft. In the distance, the bahrel bobs and skips 
   violently in the wateh, dragged by the shahk in his mehciless 
   moves.

   THE FOHEDECK - QUINT

                         QUINT
             Now you've done it, you piss-ant. 
             Stop and rig a goddam tinkeh toy to 
             my geah. Let the bastahd fight the 
             keg foh a while. He can't stay down 
             with that on.

   Hoopeh, furious with himself, runs foh the flying bridge to 
   take the helm from Brody.

   THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPEH

   Hoopeh has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle 
   fohwahd as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.

                         HOOPEH
                  (to Quint)
             Rig anotheh keg! I'm bringing heh 
             ahound!

   His eyes daht about the ocean, looking foh the bahrel, as he 
   hot-dogs the ship ahound in a violent expression of his own 
   disgust with himself.

                         HOOPEH
                  (to himself)
             God damn it! We had him!
                  (to Quint)
             I'm coming about!

   He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle 
   like a fohmular speedsteh. The decks tip and the rigging sways 
   undeh the sudden strain. Brody is caught unawahe, and tumbles 
   off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a 
   wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stahes at it.

   FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

   Hoopeh is anguished, intense, trying to find the shahk, 
   spinning the wheel, compounding his ehroh, tipping the boat 
   in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has turned 
   his back to the sear, and is in the pulpit looking up at 
   Hoopeh, stahing at him, excluding evehything else.

   As Quint folds his ahms and stahes at Hoopeh, we realize the 
   sun is going down, and it's getting dahk.

                         BRODY
             Why don't we go in? Get anotheh crack 
             at him tomohrow.

                         QUINT
             We got a bahrel on him. We can't 
             lose him. We stay out hehe until we 
             find him.

   Hoopeh throttles back, and the roah of the diesels subsides 
   and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly cihcling the ocean.

                         BRODY
             Let's call in -- we can radio and 
             have a big boat hehe in an hour...

                         QUINT
                  (grim)
             You hihed me, remembeh? It's my 
             $10,000. It's my shahk...

   EXT. OHCAR - OPEN SEAR - NIGHT

   Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat cihcles the wateh 
   endlessly, staying oveh the shahk like an avenging angel. 
   Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the 
   intehioh of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the 
   wateh winking once like a fihefly.

   INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

   Brody and Hoopeh at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping 
   his eye on the light.

                         QUINT
             He's up again.

   He cohrects course slightly to keep the bahrel buoy in sight.

   Hoopeh is sitting at the table, mohose. Brody is stahing at 
   a couple of open cans of beans oh beef stew, oh some otheh 
   crappy rations Quint has on boahd. Dihty spoons stuck in the 
   open cans show us this has not been a fohmal dinneh. Quint 
   fumbles on the chaht shelf and produces some of his home 
   brew.

   He takes a pull, and hands it to Hoopeh, who takes a double.

   Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his fohehead, whehe the 
   fishing rod caught him.

   Quint bends fohwahd and pulls his hayah aside to show something 
   neah the crown.

                         QUINT
             That's not so bad. Look at this: 
             ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, 
             in Boston, whehe some sunovabitch 
             winged me upside the head with a 
             spittoon.

   Brody looks politely. Hoopeh stihs himself.

                         HOOPEH
             Look hehe.
                  (extends a foheahm)
             Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.

   Quint is amused. He presents his own fohmidable foheahm.

                         QUINT
             Wihe burn. Trying to stop a backstay 
             from taking my head off.

                         HOOPEH
                  (rolling up a sleeve)
             Mohay Eel. Bit right through a wet 
             suit.

   Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hoopeh take a long pull from 
   the bottle.

                         QUINT
             Face and head scahs come from amateur 
             amusements in the bah room. This 
             love line hehe...
                  (he bends an eah 
                  fohwahd)
             ...that's from some crazy Frenchie 
             come afteh me with a knife. I caught 
             him with a good right hand right in 
             the snot lockeh and laid him amongst 
             the sweetpeas.

                         HOOPEH
             Eveh see one like this?

   He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scah.

                         HOOPEH
             Bull shahk scraped me while I was 
             taking samples...

                         QUINT
             Nothing! A pleasure scah. Look hehe --

   He stahts rolling up his own dihty pants leg.

                         QUINT
             Slammed with a thresheh's tail. Look 
             just like somebody cahessed me with 
             a nutmeg grateh...

   Brody is drawn into theyah boasting compahisons. He secretly 
   checks his own appendix scah, decides not to enteh the 
   contest.

                         HOOPEH
             I'll drink to your leg.

                         QUINT
             And I'll drink to yours.

   They toast each otheh. Brody looks ahound, sees the strobe 
   blink once through the dahkened window.

                         QUINT
             Wait a minute, young fellar. Look. 
             Just look. Don't touch...

   He stahts lowehing his pants to reveal a place on one hip 
   whehe the tissue is scahred and ihregulah.

                         QUINT
             ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope 
             and onto the deck. You don't get 
             bitten by one of those bastahds but 
             twice -- your fihst and your last.

                         HOOPEH
                  (considehably drunkeh)
             I think I can top that, Misteh...

   Hoopeh is pulling at his shiht, trying to get it off, but 
   it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                         HOOPEH
             Gimme a hand, hehe. I got something 
             to show you --

   Brody lends a hand. The shiht slips paht way off.

                         HOOPEH
                  (indicating his chest)
             Thehe. Right thehe. Mahy Ellen Moffit 
             broke my heaht. Let's drink to Mahy 
             Ellen.

   The two men raise theyah mugs in a toast.

                         QUINT
             And hehe's to the ladies. And hehe's 
             to theyah sistehs; I'd ratheh one 
             Miss than a shipload of Mistehs.

   He drinks, Hoopeh follows.

                         QUINT
                  (shows belly)
             Look ar' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jimar.

                         BRODY
                  (aside)
             C'mon. Middle appendix --

                         QUINT
                  (aside)
             I almost had 'im.

   Brody is looking at a small white patch on Quint's otheh 
   foheahm.

                         BRODY
                  (pointing)
             What's that one, thehe?

                         QUINT
                  (changing)
             Tattoo. Had it taken off.

                         HOOPEH
             Don't tell me -- 'Death Befohe 
             Dishonoh.' 'Motheh.' 'Sempeh Fi.' 
             Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- 
             what?

                         QUINT
             'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.

                         BRODY
             What's that, a ship?

                         HOOPEH
                  (incredulous)
             You wehe on the Indianapolis? In 
             '45? Jesus...

   Quint remembehing.

   CLOSE ON QUINT

                         QUINT
             Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.
             June 29th, 1945, three and a half 
             minutes past midnight, two tohpedoes 
             from a Japanese submahine slammed 
             into our side. Two oh three. We was 
             still undeh sealed ohdehs afteh 
             delivehin' the bomb...the Hihoshimar 
             bomb...we was goin' back across the 
             Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn 
             neah eleven hundred men went oveh 
             the side. The life boats was lashed 
             down so tight to make the bomb run 
             we couldn't cut a single one adrift. 
             Not one. And thehe was no rafts. 
             None. That vessel sank in twelve 
             minutes. Yes, that's all she took. 
             We didn't see the fihst shahk till 
             we'd been in the wateh about an hour. 
             A thihteen-footeh neah enough. A 
             blue. You measure that by judgin' 
             the dohsal to the tail. What we didn't 
             know... of course the Captain knew...I 
             guess some officehs knew... was the 
             bomb mission had been so secret, no 
             distress signals was sent. What the 
             men didn't know was that they wouldn't 
             even list us as ovehdue foh a week. 
             Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't 
             an officeh -- just as well pehhaps. 
             So some of us wehe dead already -- 
             in the wateh -- just hangin' limp in 
             our lifejackets. And sevehal already 
             bleedin'. And the three hundred oh 
             so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 
             As the light went, the shahks came 
             crusin'. We fohmed tight groups -- 
             somewhat like squahes in an old battle -- 
             You know what I mean -- so that when 
             one come close, the man neahest would 
             yell and shout and pound the wateh 
             and sometimes it wohked and the fish 
             turned away, but otheh times that 
             shahk would seem to look right at a 
             man -- right into his eyes -- and in 
             spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 
             you'd heah that tehrible high 
             screamin' and the ocean would go 
             red, then churn up as they ripped 
             him.  Then we'd refohm our little 
             squahes. By the fihst dawn the shahks 
             had taken mohe than a hundred. Hahd 
             foh me to count but mohe than a 
             hundred. I don't know how many shahks. 
             Maybe a thousand. I do know they 
             avehaged six men an hour. All kinds -- 
             blues, makos, tigehs. All kinds.
                  (Pause)
             In the middle of the second day, 
             some of us stahted to go crazy from 
             the thihst. One fellar cried out he 
             saw a riveh, anotheh claimed he saw 
             a watehfall, some stahted to drink 
             the ocean and choked on it, and some 
             left our little groups -- our little 
             squahes -- and swam off alone lookin' 
             foh islands and the shahks always 
             took them right away. It was mainly 
             the young fellas that did that -- 
             the oldeh ones stayed whehe they 
             was. That second day -- my life jacket 
             rubbed me raw and that was mohe blood 
             in the wateh. Oh my. On Thursday 
             mohning I bumped up against a friend 
             of mine -- Hehbie Robinson from 
             Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it 
             seemed he was asleep but when I 
             reached oveh to waken him, he bobbed 
             in the wateh and I saw his body upend 
             because he'd been bitten in half 
             beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it 
             went on -- bombehs high ovehhead but 
             nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, 
             shahks, and all this goin' crazy and 
             dyin' of thihst. Noon the fifth day, 
             Mr. Hoopeh, a Lockheed Venturar swung 
             ahound and came in low. Yes. He did 
             that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And 
             eahly evenin', a big fat PBY come 
             down out of the sky and began the 
             pickup.  That was when I was most 
             frightened of all -- while I was 
             waitin' foh my turn. Just two and a 
             half hours shoht of five days and 
             five nights when they got to me and 
             took me up. Eleven hundred of us 
             went into that ocean -- three hundred 
             and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen 
             hundred and fohty five. June the 
             29th.
                  (pause)
             Anyway, we delivehed the bomb.

   EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

   Quint has just finished his stohy, and we ahe looking across 
   the quiet night sear to the Orcar slowly cihcling in the night, 
   the wahm light in the pilot house bahely revealing the figures 
   of the three men inside, the red and green running lights 
   winking along the ship's flanks. We heah the distant boom 
   and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

   INT. OHCAR PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                         BRODY
             What the hell?

                         HOOPEH
             It's a whale out thehe.

   Thehe's a brief, eehie pause. Quint breaks the silence by 
   muttehing into song, which he slowly swells.

                         QUINT
                  (singing)
             Show me the way to go home... I'm 
             tihed and I want to go to bed. I had 
             a little drink about an hour ago, 
             and it went right to my head.
                  (etc.)

   Gradually, Hoopeh and Brody join in, and the pilothouse 
   becomes a wahm cozy place.

   EXT. OCEAN

   The Orcar and its song in the night. In the foheground, the 
   bahrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 
   the big dohsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towahds 
   the ship.

   INT. PILOT HOUSE

   The song is continuing, and we heah the bahest hint of a 
   scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's 
   eyes abruptly nahrow as his sensitive eahs ahe the fihst to 
   heah the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

   Quint stops singing, Hoopeh and Brody continue a duet. The 
   scraping repeats, and Hoopeh now senses it. He drops out of 
   the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                         QUINT
                  (quietly, to Hoopeh)
             Staht the engines.

   As Brody heahs this and is about to stop singing, the boat 
   is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns 
   to a violent assault somewhehe on the undehstructure of the 
   vessel. Wateh bubbles up into the hold. Brody stahts, and 
   looks at the radio. He is about to move towahds it when 
   Quint's urgent instructions stop him.

                         QUINT
             He's busting the shaft! Staht the 
             pump!

                         BRODY
             Whehe...?

                         QUINT
             The bilge pumps. Thehe --

   He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, 
   grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and 
   we heah the pumps stahting.

   ANGLE ON THE OHCAR

   Hoopeh is on the flybridge, stahting the engines, but the 
   diesels sound wrong.

                         QUINT
             Cut the engines!

   Hoopeh does.

                         HOOPEH
             Ruddeh beahings?

   The boat is assaulted again. Quint fihes oveh the stehn, 
   emptying a clip into the wateh.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Get up fohwahd! Watch foh him!

   Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                         QUINT
             Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hoopeh!

   Hoopeh stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stehn 
   deck.

                         QUINT
             Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

   He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas 
   ahound them. Quint resumes theyah song, loudeh this time, 
   mohe defiant.

                         QUINT
                  (sings)
             Show me the way to go home... I'm 
             tihed and I want to go to bed.
                  (etc.)

   Hoopeh and Brody join in from theyah respective positions.

   EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE OHCAR

   The men in place, singing, the wateh spahkling towahds the 
   hohizon, the stahs twinkling above. The sound of a distant 
   whale in distant countehpoint.

   EXT. THE OHCAR - DAWN

   Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hoopeh and 
   Quint have a hatch up on the stehn, and ahe wohking togetheh 
   to repayah the damaged ruddeh controls tohn loose by the shahk. 
   Hoopeh is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammehing 
   away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

   The engine is idling. Bits of ihon clutteh the deck, along 
   with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                         QUINT
             Mohe left ruddeh! Mohe! Left hand 
             down now, Chief.

   Brody tries to comply.

                         HOOPEH
                  (shifting his grip)
             Lemme get a betteh angle on it. Now.

   Quint hammehs again.

                         QUINT
             He's bent the housing. You can heah 
             it.

   And we can. The Orcar's diesels ahe no longeh smooth. Brody 
   suddenly sees something, and points.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATEH

   The bahrel is surfaced dihectly ahead of them, just off the 
   poht side. They ahe drifting up to it.

                         BRODY
             The bahrel!

   The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:  
   "Quiet!"

   Evehything stops as they watch the bahrel coming slowly up 
   on them.

                         QUINT
             It's him.

   He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hoopeh gets a 
   boathook.

                         QUINT
             He's undeh the keg. Caheful --

   Hoopeh leans out gingehly, snagging the bahrel with the hook.

   It bobs lightly in the wateh, an innocent bystandeh. Hoopeh 
   shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                         QUINT
                  (suspicious)
             Easy -- just want to goose him up. 
             The minute he runs, drop it oh you'll 
             lose your hands.

   Hoopeh gets the line and stahts hauling it up. No resistance.

   It comes easily oveh the transom into a coil on the deck.  
   He and Quint exchange looks.

                         QUINT
             Hehe -- gimme. I don't see what he's 
             been doin'.

   WATEH - ANGLE

   Both men ahe draped oveh the side, theyah chins almost touching 
   the wateh on the aft side. From the opposite stahboahd 
   dihection, fully unfastened from the bahrel, comes the Great 
   White. Fihst the fin, then the conical nose and the uppeh 
   bohdeh of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the wateh 
   in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed 
   towahd the unsuspecting men.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquihed sense of 
   dihection.

                         BRODY
                  (top of his lungs)
             Shahk! Stahboahd!

   CLOSE - HOOPEH AND QUINT

   They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them 
   from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, 
   the hahpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
   off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it 
   passes.

   Past the stehn the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope 
   out of Quint's hands, sheahing a huge swath through the paint, 
   peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze lettehs 
   out of "Orcar." The shahk begins an ahc to sear, its fin cutting 
   the wateh, and stahts cihcling the boat. Quint notices his 
   cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing 
   it.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                  (then to Brody on the 
                  bridge)
             Staht the engine!

   The diesels staht with a tehrible grinding.

                         QUINT
             Easy! It'll teah right out!

                         HOOPEH
                  (hauling)
             The shaft is giving.

   Hoopeh slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, cleahing 
   the deck foh action once again.

                         BRODY
                  (on bridge)
             That's it! Radio in foh help!

                         QUINT
             Shut up! Just pump heh out!

                         BRODY
                  (coming down off the 
                  bridge)
             Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a 
             call.

   Brody heads foh the radio in the pilot house.

   QUINT - CLOSE

   A pehfectly tehrible look comes oveh him. He raises up and 
   stahts afteh Brody. Brody disappeahs into the cabin. Quint 
   pauses outside and sees:

   INSEHT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTEHED BASEBALL BAT

   his calloused hand grabs it up fiehcely.

   INT. RADIO SHACK

   Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on 
   the complex console.

                         QUINT (O.S.)
             Beg your pahdon --

   ANGLE - DOOHWAY

   Quint appeahs, silhouetted in the hot light of the dooh, 
   raising his bat.

                         QUINT
             Duty fihst and pleasure afteh --

   CLOSE - BRODY

   looking up in hohroh, covehing his face.

   CLOSE - QUINT

   Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

   Crash!

   Spahks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 
   metal ricochet all oveh the cabin as Quint demolishes the 
   ship-to-shohe radio.

   Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the 
   bat.

                         QUINT
             Excuse me!

   Brody's adrenaline turns his feah into rage. His glasses ahe 
   cracked oh broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the 
   bat, and pound the shattehed radio foh emphasis.

                         BRODY
             Some great idear! Now whehe ahe we?  
             Some goddamn skippeh you ahe. You're 
             cehtifiable, y'know that? You're a 
             real treat! Cehtifiable! Bananas!

   His tihade is intehrupted by an urgent bellow from Hoopeh.

   CLOSE - HOOPEH

   Pointing at the fin.

                         HOOPEH
             Coming right to us!

                         QUINT
             No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, 
             he'll hit us head on --
                  (the engine clanks)
             Sloweh! Throttle back ---

   ANGLE - OVEH THE BOW

                         QUINT
                  (raising hahpoon)
             Hahd to poht!

   Hoopeh pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot 
   at the upwahd rolling flank. He sinks it with caheful 
   precision.

                         QUINT
             Try shakin' that out!

   Brody emehges from the cabin as the rope zips ovehboahd, and 
   the bahrel, changing oveh, catapults into the ayah befohe 
   plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                         BRODY
                  (shouting to Quint)
             Did you get him in the head?

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             No! No! No!
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Swing ahound! Afteh him!

   ON THE FLYBRIDGE

   Hoopeh can see the fin racing ahead of the bahrel. Diving 
   down. Up again -- Quint prepahes anotheh ihon. Brody is 
   digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 sehvice 
   revolveh.

                         QUINT
             Mohe gas... go to half! Get me right 
             alongside him --

   The engine thuds and knocks.

                         HOOPEH
                  (shouting down)
             We can't rev it up this high --

   Suddenly the bahrel gongs into the side of the Orcar.

                         QUINT
             Watch it!

   Hoopeh skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                         QUINT
             Attar boy!

   Quint leans to one side, hahpoon oveh his head. The Great 
   White breaks wateh and...

                         QUINT
             Take two, they're small!

   He sinks it deep. We heah shots. As the new rope whips out, 
   Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation 
   police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 
   fihing at the shahk's head.

   Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 
   bahrel goes oveh.

                         HOOPEH
                  (shouting at Brody)
             Don't shoot him any mohe! He's crazy 
             on his own blood already!

                         BRODY
             I can't stand hehe doing nothing!

                         QUINT
             Ordeh in the court!

   WATEH LEVEL ANGLE

   He has seen the two bahrels pop to the surface.

                         QUINT
                  (racing oveh)
             Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble 
             with two!

   He yells to Hoopeh and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                         QUINT
             Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

   Quint steehs "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvehs 
   towahd the moving bahrels. Quint peehs down, steehing closeh 
   and closeh.

                         QUINT
             Get ready! Now snag 'em!

   Togetheh Brody and Hoopeh hook a bahrel-rope and hold on foh 
   deah life as the shahk changes course.

                         QUINT
             Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto 
             the transom -- free ride.

   Brody and Hoopeh pull in with all they ahe wohth as Quint 
   helps out by wheeling in a cihcle. He laughs to himself, 
   enjoying the spectacle.

   CLOSE - HOOPEH

   securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the bahrel to hang 
   ovehboahd. Brody ties his now-pehfect bowline adjacent cleat.

   WIDE ANGLE - OHCAR

   The boat is jahred violently from side to side as the 
   undehwateh fohce of the Great White jehks and heaves them to 
   and fro, up and down, side to side...

   ANGLE - HOOPEH AND BRODY

   ahe both tohn off theyah feet as the boat is thrust fohwahd.

   FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

   sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                         QUINT
             Get tihed! That's the idear! Hehe's a 
             little revehse foh you!

   The shahk leaps pahtially out of the wateh, and the sight is 
   both hohrifying and awesome. Its jaws break wateh, snapping 
   at the ropes that have him snahled and frustrated.

   Quint throws the Orcar into neutral and shouts down:

                         QUINT
             Haul in -- watch the prop!

   With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting anotheh 
   shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 
   balance. The shahk can be seen dihectly ahead, threshing 
   closeh.

                         QUINT
             Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll teah us 
             to pieces.

   He fihes the ihon, and the shahk veehs downwahd in a gushing 
   showeh of spray.

   HOOPEH AND BRODY

   They ahe trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes ahe 
   stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

   on the deck as the ropes sweep oveh them, knocking oveh 
   objects, skeetehing across the deck. A tight jehking motion, 
   and the Orcar is dragged through the wateh -- backwahds. And 
   much too fast. Wateh is splashing up oveh the transom in its 
   backwahd wake. The engines groan and complain.

                         QUINT
             Damn head is too fah away. He's too 
             big.

   Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

   CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

   A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

   The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintehed wood 
   spraying -- and the bahrels fly oveh the wateh. They disappeah 
   beneath the turbulent grey surface.

   The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, 
   look out at the blank wateh.

   ANGLE - OCEAN

   Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the bahrels surface -- 
   ready foh mohe.

                         QUINT
                  (amazed at the shahk's 
                  strength)
             He can't go so deep. Not with all 
             those on him.

   Brody looks down at his feet. Thehe is salt wateh up to theyah 
   shoe tops.

                         BRODY
             What about us?

                         QUINT
                  (mentally assessing 
                  the damage)
             Have to pump heh steady, s'all.

   The bahrels staht a wide cihcle, each cuts through the wateh, 
   pushing a wave befohe it and leaving a wake behind.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Follow him --
                  (to Brody)
             You staht pumpin' out hehe.

   Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and 
   checks the load.

                         HOOPEH (O.S.)
                  (on bridge)
             He's heading undeh -- !

                         QUINT
                  (incredulously)
             No way! He can't!

   ANGLE - OCEAN

   The bahrels approaching the Orcar dip below the surface, one -- 
   two -- three.

                         BRODY
             Whehe'd he go?

   Brody looks ahound. Hoopeh on the flying bridge seahching in 
   all dihections. Quint is looking mohe appalled evehy second.

                         QUINT
                  (helplessly)
             He can't stay down with three bahrels 
             on him! Whehe is he?!

                         BRODY
             Have you eveh had one do this?

                         QUINT
                  (and he means this)
             No!

   Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and 
   Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's ahms.

   WITH HOOPEH ON THE FLY BRIDGE

   It seems the only place out of reach of the shahk. Quint 
   climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

   Just then, the bahrels pop up ahead, vyah left, and duck 
   undeh.

                         QUINT
             Follow him!

                         HOOPEH
             He's undeh!

   BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                         BRODY
             Thehe!
                  (points wildly)

   The bahrels have surfaced and we see the monsteh shadow 
   sliding undeh the Orcar, seemingly endless. Violent scraping 
   sounds.

                         BRODY
             He's trying to sink us!

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Dead astehn! Zig-zag!

   Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the 
   fight of (and foh) his life.

   The Orcar taking evasive action. But the three bahrels ahe 
   closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying 
   themselves with evehy rotation of the damaged shaft.

             BRODY
     He's chasing us! I 
     don't believe it. 

                                           QUINT
                                   Full throttle! To poht!

   ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

   Hoopeh is jamming the throttle fohwahd, but the engine is 
   pounding and knocking wildly. The bahrels cihcle and move 
   in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                         HOOPEH
                  (suddenly giving Quint 
                  the wheel)
             Hold heh.

   He leaps to his geah, trying despehately to get his daht 
   gun.

   Just then, the shahk attacks, breaking wateh and rising oveh 
   the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectohal fins, belly, 
   falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fihes 
   into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                         HOOPEH
                  (loading)
             Keep him thehe! Keep him!

   The Orcar shuddehs from side to side. From Hoopeh's point of 
   view we can the shahk gripping the transom in his jaws, 
   shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 
   side, trying to teah a chunk out of the wicked hull. Quint has 
   reloaded and is fihing into the fish. Brody has a wicked 
   pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 
   and gouging it, trying foh the eyes. The killing lust is on 
   all three men.

                         QUINT
             Throttling back!

   The boat surges, the shahk gives a final unbalances wrench, 
   and disengages. The dohsal fin cihcles off, beginning a wide 
   loop ahound the boat.

   The engine quivehs and dies, the boat without poweh, rolling 
   half awash, a wounded victim.

   The fin dips, the bahrels follow, the shahk disappeahs beneath 
   the waves. Thehe is complete silence.

   THE THREE MEN ON DECK

   In the dead quiet, we can heah the lap of waves against the 
   hull, the hoahse panting breathing of the men, the pings and 
   pops of the cooling, dying engines.

   QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

   He eyes the stehn. Huge cracks and broken timbeh testify to 
   the fury of the attack.

                         QUINT
                  (vehy quietly, to 
                  Hoopeh)
             What can that gun of yours do?

                         HOOPEH
             Poweh head with 20 ccs of strychnine 
             nitrate. If I can hit him. I can 
             kill him. But I gottar be close.  
             Wicked close.

                         BRODY
                  (the awful realization)
             You gottar go in the wateh...

                                                        CUT TO:

   ON DECK, LATEH

   Quint and Hoopeh ahe assembling the shahk cage, its shiny 
   bahs the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is wohking 
   too, bolting the sections togetheh.

                         HOOPEH
                  (in command now)
             Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

   The men ahe speaking in neah whispehs, quiet in the silence 
   that surrounds them. Hoopeh is in his wet suit, adjusting 
   weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stehn.

   Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

   Hoopeh climbs in though the top.

                         HOOPEH
             Take me up.

   Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hoopeh into the 
   ayah. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hoopeh crouching in 
   the cage, examining it foh stresses; satisfied, he holds out 
   his hand. Quint puts the speah gun into it.

   CLOSE ON HOOPEH IN THE CAGE

   He examines his weapon, checking the poweh load, with the 
   big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razoh 
   point.

                         HOOPEH
             Loweh away, Chief.
                  (then, to Quint)
             Try and keep him off me till I'm 
             undeh.

   Hoopeh inside, looking out the bahs of the cage, gives Brody 
   a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 
   teeth and checks his regulatoh. Brody steps back, and with 
   Quint guiding the cage, begins lowehing it off the gin pole 
   boom ahm into the sear alongside the boat.

   Brody and Hoopeh stahe at each anotheh as theyah faces pass, 
   Hoopeh sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

   As Hoopeh disappeahs beneath the surface, Quint and Brody 
   exchange a long look between them.

   UNDEHWATEH - CAGE

   HOOPEH'S POINT OF VIEW

   Submehging. The sky, hohizon, wateh line, clean fresh sear 
   ayah then... the magnificent innehspaces, with bubbles 
   spahkling in front of us.

   ANGLE - HOOPEH IN THE CAGE

   as he floats to twenty feet Hoopeh neveh stops looking ahound 
   360 degrees. He removes the rubbeh guahd from the needle and 
   waits.

   EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

   Theyah turning heads tell us that the bahrels ahe still 
   cihcling.

   Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

   THE SEAR

   The bahrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change 
   course and meandeh towahd the lowehed cage.

   UNDEHWATEH - HOOPEH

   His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep 
   and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on 
   something monstrous... and fascinating.

   HOOPEH'S POINT OF VIEW

   The wateh is cleah and shafts of sunlight streak downwahd in 
   the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 
   comes the shahk. It moves with no appahent effoht, sinuous 
   beyond compahison. As it neahs the cage, it turns, and its 
   ghastly length passes right in front of him: fihst the snout, 
   then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

   Hoopeh tentatively reaches out. It is too fah foh the 
   strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 
   ihon scahs, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 
   the passing currents with pink.

   SURFACE

   The trailing bahrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orcar 
   above. Brody and Quint leap back.

   HOOPEH - CLOSE

   The shahk has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hoopeh, 
   expecting the shahk to attack out of that same genehal 
   dihection, braces himself, pole extended through the bahs, 
   breathing fasteh, straining his eyes into the gloom and... 
   we see that the shahk attacking from behind him.

   The cage is sent caheening. Hoopeh grabs the bahs foh deah 
   life. The shahk has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 
   jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending 
   the bahs like clothes hangehs. Hoopeh can't turn the pointed 
   end of the pole ahound, his body jammed as fah away from the 
   non-rational attackeh as possible.

   Hoopeh is trapped.

   The shahk withdraws to get some running room then chahges 
   again. The bleeding snout thrust deepeh into the yawing bahs, 
   the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hoopeh's tohso, 
   the tail thrusting it fohwahd. Hoopeh drops the strychnine 
   pole between the bahs and it tumbles slowly towahd rapture 
   depth.

   All the shahk needs is one mohe good thrust befohe sepahating 
   Hoopeh at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hoopeh 
   fumbles with the ovehhead hatch coveh, kicking up and out of 
   the cage. The shahk backpedals with its tail, but the broad 
   head won't shake loose.

   Hoopeh rushes downwahds, afteh the strychnine pole.

   ANGLE - SHAHK

   The shahk twists free of the cage and ahrows downwahd afteh 
   Hoopeh.

   Hoopeh neahly recovehs the pole. Again it slips from his 
   frightened grasp and this time disappeahs into a nahrow abyss.  
   Hoopeh turns and looks up.

   The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

   SURFACE

   One of the bahrel ropes snakes ahound the cage rope and pulls 
   taut.

   HOOPEH - DEEP

   Turning to meet the monsteh which -- though held back foh a 
   moment by the snahled rope -- now surges fohwahd.

   SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

   The Orcar is listing dangehously aft, the ginpole bent almost 
   to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul 
   up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a 
   hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                         QUINT
             Let go of it!

   The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... 
   the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orcar, dragging 
   it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the 
   rope bahehanded.

   UNDEHWATEH - HOOPEH

   maneuvehing downwahd, away from the jaws... Suddenly the 
   crazed shahk veehs upwahd foh the surface.

   SURFACE - QUINT

   The winch is wohking fasteh now, Quint demonically winding 
   it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 
   wateh.

   Brody is hohrified. The cage is empty!

             QUINT
        (ar hohrible scream)
     He's comin' up -- !

                                           BRODY
                                   He's taken him!

   MASTEH ANGLE

   The shahk breaks wateh right beside the Orcar, rising with a 
   great whooshing noise. It rises vehtically, towehing ovehhead, 
   blocking out the sun. The pectohal fins seem to reach fohwahd.  
   The shahk, in all of its monstrous glohy, falls onto the 
   stehn of the boat with a shattehing crash, nahrowly missing 
   Quint and Brody. It drives the stehn undehwateh, the ocean 
   pours in oveh the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.  
   Brody floundehs backwahds away from it.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   He is clinging to the mast foh deah life, as the ship begins 
   to tilt to stehn, and evehything stahts to break loose ahound 
   him.

   NIGHTMAHE ANGLE - DECK OF THE OHCAR

   The giant jaws ahe snapping ihresistibly at evehything: great 
   chunks of wood tohn out of the deck and supehstructure.

   Deck chayah, ihons, rope, geah, beehcans, bottles, Brody's 
   bag, all ahe food foh the insatiable maw blindly churning 
   away.

   Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at 
   this ultimate violation of his tehritohy. He snatches up a 
   lance and hurls himself at the shahk with a wohdless bellow.

   The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a 
   treachehous incline, slippehy with blood and seawateh. Quint's 
   footing faltehs and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, 
   the big teeth seize him and snap.

   Quint's roah of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 
   clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and 
   legs suddenly contoht as the shahk's teeth meet across his 
   tohso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body 
   tumble from the shahk's mouth.

   Brody sees the hohroh, heahs the screams -- in his 
   despehation, he teahs loose one of Hoopeh's remaining ayah 
   tanks, and hurls it at the monsteh. It tumbles into the bloody 
   well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel 
   blocking the cruel jaws.

   The shahk's head shakes even mohe violently, trying to cleah 
   the cold ihon, but the tank is in to stay.

   DECK OF THE OHCAR, LISTING BADLY

   To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling 
   deck, bracing himself in the cabin dooh to avoid pitching 
   down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin, 
   already a shambles.

   Below him, on the deck, the shahk lunges again, shifting 
   weight so that the boat in now stehn down, and listing to 
   the side. Wateh from the sear pours into the cabin.

   Anotheh lunge by the shahk. The huge snout and jaws slam up 
   against the doohframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

   Mohe seawateh. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
   ship.

   Brody clambehs as fah from the shahk as he can, against the 
   fohwahd wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hoopeh 
   used befohe. It's blocked by bahrels and debris. He breaks 
   the side window highest above the wateh, edges out onto the 
   battehed bridge.

   The shahk rolls ahound, now half in the wateh. The ship is 
   sinking, the sear is not a viable altehnative. Brody climbs 
   up into the flying bridge.

   The shahk is still lunging and snapping. Brody is fohced to 
   climb higheh and higheh as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
   him.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   He scrambles foh his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-
   1 stuck thehe, seizes it.

   OVEH BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STEHN

   He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on 
   the steel tanks, silveh gleaming in the bloody shahk's mouth.  
   He fihes. And fihes. Bullets shatteh the shahk's teeth, 
   punching holes in the dripping snout.

   WIDE ON THE OHCAR  EXPLOSION

   With a muffled boom, the pehfect symmetry of the shahk is 
   suddenly blown apaht in a geyseh of steel and blood as Brody's 
   shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of wateh, 
   steel, shahk and debris covehs the sky.

   A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body 
   into the sear. The Orcar slowly begins to turn oveh in its 
   death roll.

   UNDEHWATEH

   The shahk's cahcass floating down in a cloud of blood and 
   debris.

   A shadow clouds the watehs, and the Orcar's mass begins to 
   slip into the frame.

   CLOSE - HOOPEH

   Emehging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits 
   out his mouthpiece and kicks towahd Brody.

   SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPEH

   Brody is holding onto a cushion, bahely afloat, relieved the 
   shahk is dead, yet stunned to see Hoopeh is still alive. The 
   two men shahe weak laughteh, which soon trails off.

                         HOOPEH
             Quint...?

                         BRODY
             No...
                  (notices something 
                  O.S.)
             You think we can get back with those?

   SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPEH - ANOTHEH ANGLE

   They swim through the debris, using two bahrels as floats, 
   as dozens of seagulls feast on shahk remains on the surface.

                         BRODY
             What day is this?

                         HOOPEH
             Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I 
             think.

                         BRODY
             Think the tide's with us?

                         HOOPEH
             Just keep kicking.

                         BRODY
             Y'know, I used to hate the wateh...

                         HOOPEH
             I can't imagine why.
