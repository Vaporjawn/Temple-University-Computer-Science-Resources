    "As an aside, the recursive algorithm for reversing the sequence is tail-recursive, meaning that any recursive call made from one context is the very last operation in that context, with the return value of the recursive call (if any) immediately returned by the enclosing recursion. An examle of *non*-tail-recursive algorthm is the `factorial` function above. It is non-tail-recursive because of the additional multiplication by $n$ in the `return n * factorial(n-1)` call. This multiplication is carried out *after* the recursive call is completed.  \n",

    "How would one prove that the recursive algorithm for finding the sum of the first positive integers, for example, is correct? (Example 6). The argument can go like this: *Basis Step:* The sum of the first positive integer is 1, which is the answer the algorithm returns when n = 1 and the sequence `S = [1, 2, 3, ..., n]` is passed to it. *Inductive Step:* Now assume the algorithm is correct for `n = k`. If `n = k + 1`, the the `else` clause in the algorithm is executed and the `k + 1`-st integer is added to the sum of the first `k` integers, which is assumed to be correct. Therefore, the algorithm correctly finds the sum of the first `k + 1` integers. "
